Message to a friend 10th September 2023:

00:05.360 --> 00:10.080
Did you know that the pagan Roman emperor Julian fixed the price of corn by law in Antioch?

00:11.200 --> 00:14.400
Then he tried to supply the market with corn at this price,

00:15.919 --> 00:19.440
either from the state or via assets which he had control over.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.440
The landowners being a monopoly or oligarchy simply withheld the supplying of corn to the

00:25.440 --> 00:30.080
market thus elevating the price, preferring to store it for the next year instead.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.880
Julian had all the landowners, the senate of Antioch, arrested and incarcerated for a very

00:36.880 --> 00:43.120
small amount of time before he forgave them and let them go free again. State control in this way

00:43.120 --> 00:48.159
reminds me of something akin to Soviet Russia, which caused a lot of starvation, especially

00:48.159 --> 00:55.200
in the Ukraine. I see occasionally posters for communism put on walls in York, but these

00:55.200 --> 01:04.079
are usually pulled down or defaced in a short time. A year earlier, on Friday the 21st October 2022,

01:04.079 --> 01:08.640
I wrote to my friend, having completed my first pass of Keynes's general theory,

01:08.640 --> 01:14.079
he has introduced me to Mummery and Hobson's Physiology of Industry 1889, which is wonderfully

01:14.079 --> 01:20.719
written if in error in places. Each model depends upon underlying assumptions,

01:20.799 --> 01:23.760
and political economy is about discerning truth within those.

01:25.200 --> 01:31.519
Re: Orwell's comments about another author, like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome was burning,

01:31.519 --> 01:35.920
but playing it with his face turned towards the flames, I recalled that Orwell said this

01:35.920 --> 01:41.359
about Henry Miller, who wrote Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn in the 1930s or thereabouts.

01:42.319 --> 01:47.280
I say this because I perceive Western civilization as already reached the beginning of its end,

01:47.280 --> 01:53.280
and the situation is very grave. A model based upon flawed underlying assumptions can be more

01:53.280 --> 01:59.040
complex than, for example, no model at all. It can then produce a prediction which matches

01:59.040 --> 02:05.120
an observation by incorrect reasons, a type 3 error, and become much feted, but nevertheless wrong

02:05.120 --> 02:10.879
though. Very easy to get bogged down in a myriad of functions and statistics without knowing what

02:10.879 --> 02:14.479
is relevant to be sought.
