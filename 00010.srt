00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Introduction -- part 3. The Bank of Amsterdam.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,719
The Bank of Amsterdam was established in the year 1609, in response to a problem which

3
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:26,859
emerged in small states, such as Genoa, or Hamburg, whereby the local currency was not

4
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:38,359
desirable for international trade, i.e. merchants did not wish to use it, and in preference

5
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:45,439
they elected to use coins of neighbouring states which were more internationally recognised,

6
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:53,200
and accepted, in foreign trade. In particular, coins such as the Mexico

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,120
dollars was well trusted to have a specific well-known amount of silver of an ascertained

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:12,320
purity. This was important because these coins, if so desired, could be melted down,

9
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:23,000
and formed into bullion, or items such as trinkets, jewellery, snuff boxes, etc.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
People knew exactly how much silver was contained in a Mexico dollar, so it would have been

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,280
more effective as a durable, portable thing, desirable in exchange, for which other commodities

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:50,240
could be exchanged, i.e. bought. To addle this, there were also French crowns,

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Dutch guilders, and stivers, English silver coin, Ducatoons, Rix dollars, Portuguese

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:20,240
coin, new Louis d'ors, old Louis d'ors, Ducats, among others. If a small state chose to reform

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:30,439
its currency, melt down the old coin, and cast the gold or silver into new coin, while altering

16
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:39,800
the ratio of precious metal to other metal, then this would not alter the fact that merchants

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:49,360
did not wish to use this national currency in international trade. The myriad coins which

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,479
were used in international trade each weighed something different to each other, and each

19
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:07,439
had a different alleged purity of precious metal, which could not be guaranteed and ascertained

20
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:16,120
without melting the coin down. Frauds might emerge where a coin had less gold than promised,

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:28,360
and a merchant is an expert in trade, not in coins and metallurgy. He, she, one, needed

22
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:37,319
some banking system whereby a fixed, known, quantity of gold, of guaranteed purity, could

23
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:51,639
be reliably exchanged, readily. Prior to the introduction of paper money, which was originally

24
00:03:51,639 --> 00:04:01,799
instituted by numerous domestic commercial banks, unlike the Bank of Amsterdam; and prior

25
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:13,719
to the institution of banks for international trade, like the Bank of Amsterdam, payments

26
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:23,080
made by smaller merchants were orchestrated by what was called a merchant bill, drawn upon

27
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:34,759
a large reputable trader, by an agent of this trader, for an additional fee. The system worked

28
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:50,120
as follows. A small factory, or trader, in Manchester, wishes to lend some stock to a larger reputable

29
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:58,920
merchant in London, such as a large wholesaler, or a large retailer. Both parties wish this

30
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:08,920
vendible stock to be sold on to the consumer. This merchant in London is deemed trustworthy.

31
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,920
And this trustworthy wholesaler in London does not pay upfront for this advanced stock,

32
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,600
but draws up a bill of exchange, also known as a merchant's bill, which is an agreement

33
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,080
that this large trustworthy firm will pay it within six months time, from hence.

34
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,960
The small factory, or trader, in Manchester, is the supplier of stock.

35
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:56,839
The larger reputable merchant in London has a debt to the small manufacturer in Manchester.

36
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,079
Within six months time it is hoped that this stock has been sold to the consumer.

37
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:25,079
So, the smaller manufacturer, is owed a certain amount, say 10 gold sovereign coins.

38
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:38,279
This debt, this certificate as the merchant's bill, can be sold for nine and a half golden

39
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:48,439
sovereigns, if the Manchester merchant desires to lose the difference, for immediate money;

40
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:06,279
and the purchaser of this bill gains half a sovereign when the date of maturity arrives,

41
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,239
and this money becomes payable.

42
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,639
This is how the banking system operated before the establishment of banks where a trading

43
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,759
individual was facilitated to have the keeping of a bank account.

44
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,439
But here lay a subtle problem in international trade.

45
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:43,160
A reputable London merchant would pay in English silver coin, and a reputable Paris merchant would

46
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,399
pay in French silver coin.

47
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:03,240
If there would have been more silver contained in the total weight of a certain number of

48
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:12,360
English coin, in comparison with the total weight of a certain number of French coin,

49
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:22,280
then it would be more profitable, for a merchant to obtain a bill upon a reputable London merchant,

50
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,360
than a reputable French merchant.

51
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:37,080
So this would encourage a French manufacturer to sell his stock in England, rather than in France;

52
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,080
and also would encourage the English manufacturer to sell his stock in England, rather than in France.

53
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:59,080
As a consequence, silver would leave England, and be taken to France.

54
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:15,000
Silver, i.e. money, or cash, or hard currency today, always gravitates towards the place

55
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,279
where industrious labour is being performed:

56
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,320
for which stock is required, capital or material stock, to generate profit,

57
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,279
and hence to employ workers within a profitable enterprise.

58
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,759
But that is an aside for the present moment within this discussion.

59
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,879
If more silver is obtained in England, than in France,

60
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,679
the exchange is said to favour France,

61
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:19,719
and is against England: whereby the French merchant is said to gain a premium,

62
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,839
which is paid by the London merchant; and silver leaves England for France.

63
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:37,879
Contrary to this, if more silver would be obtained in France than in London,

64
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,440
then the French merchant who obtains English silver is said to give a premium,

65
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,800
and the exchange is said to favour England, and be against France.

66
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,560
This is the theory.

67
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:13,320
In reality, before the reformation of the English silver coin in King William's time, 1696,

68
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:25,160
the worth of the English coin was 25% below the worth of silver contained,

69
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,840
that it should have had, as these coins had often been clipped, and were also extremely worn.

70
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:46,280
The exchange between England and France was said to be 25% against France,

71
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,680
and hence in favour of England.

72
00:11:50,679 --> 00:12:04,919
I like to remember this as: the exchange favours the vendor of actual material goods

73
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:15,079
if they are to be encouraged by an augmentation in the receipt of a higher amount of silver upon

74
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:30,840
payment. So, we have that in King William's time, the worth of English coin was 25% below

75
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:42,280
the worth of freshly minted silver coin; and because of this, the exchange between

76
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,959
England and France was said to be 25% in favour of England.

77
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:07,639
However, if the payment was made in English coin which was non-clipped, and non-worn,

78
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:15,720
the French manufacturer who cashed a merchant's bill upon a reputable London merchant, could

79
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:26,039
then obtain more silver than the calculated amount, i.e. what Smith called the real exchange,

80
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,439
which means the actual amount of pure silver contained within 10 specific coins,

81
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:44,120
may have been greater than the agreed amount, and hence the French merchant exporting to London,

82
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,920
might get the premium.

83
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:02,360
If the French merchant could somehow select the better quality, newly freshly minted coin,

84
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:11,159
which had not been clipped or worn, then the French merchant would obviously obtain

85
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:17,959
more silver than if the merchant had been paid in old, worn, clipped coin.

86
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,480
The Bank of Amsterdam was a formulation of a banking system for international trade,

87
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,799
which avoided ambiguities and variables.

88
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,159
So, let's now talk about the Bank of Amsterdam.

89
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,159
