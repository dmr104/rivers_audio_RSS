00:00.000 --> 00:12.660
Previously, I described an Agio as being the difference between the market price of bullion

00:12.660 --> 00:19.460
and the market price of bank money.

00:19.460 --> 00:30.980
Smith, however, refers to an Agio as any difference between, say, the market price of clipped,

00:30.980 --> 00:40.260
worn coin and the market price of fresh, newly minted coin, from which that old, worn, clipped

00:40.260 --> 00:46.020
coin was melted down into.

00:46.020 --> 00:55.100
Note that the old, worn, clipped coin may have consisted of currency flooding into the country

00:55.100 --> 01:01.980
from neighbouring states, and other nations far and wide.

01:01.979 --> 01:16.420
I quote from Book 4, Chapter 3, Part 1, "Digression Concerning Banks of Deposit, particularly

01:16.420 --> 01:27.539
concerning that of Amsterdam": The money of such banks, being better than the common currency

01:27.540 --> 01:37.420
of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency

01:37.420 --> 01:47.780
was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the state.

01:47.780 --> 01:56.940
The agio of the Bank of Hamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about 14%, is

01:56.939 --> 02:04.899
the supposed difference between the good standard money of the state, and the clipt,

02:04.899 --> 02:14.860
worn, and diminished currency poured into it from all the neighbouring states.

02:14.860 --> 02:31.620
(End quote). So I define an agio to be any difference between the market price of manifestations

02:31.620 --> 02:43.780
of money, be that the difference between clipped, worn, debased currency, and freshly minted currency,

02:43.780 --> 02:52.460
or, indeed, the difference between freshly-minted currency and the bank money which was awarded

02:52.460 --> 02:59.900
in the books of the Bank of Amsterdam.

02:59.900 --> 03:09.379
Likewise, we could also describe the difference between clipped, worn, debased coin and the market

03:09.379 --> 03:21.900
price of bullion as an agio. So, an agio is defined as the difference itself pertaining

03:21.900 --> 03:40.340
to prices of manifestations of money, not a specific difference between particular endpoints.

03:40.340 --> 03:48.379
Now, I have scarcely used the word as "value" within this discussion so far.

03:48.379 --> 03:55.019
There is a reason I have avoided this, and that is because the definition of the word

03:55.019 --> 04:07.579
as "value" can have multiple definitions, and can mean different things to different people.

04:07.579 --> 04:16.180
In the final chapter, chapter 71 part 3 of Edwin Gibbon's History of the Decline and

04:16.180 --> 04:25.699
Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons states: The value of any object that supplies the

04:25.699 --> 04:35.379
wants or pleasures of mankind is compounded of its substance and its form, of the materials

04:35.379 --> 04:51.420
and the manufacture. (End quote). I agree with Gibbon. For example, the value of a piece of industrial

04:51.420 --> 04:59.060
machinery, such as a combine-harvester is what John Maynard Keynes, during the first half

04:59.060 --> 05:15.660
of the 20th century, called its "utility", and perhaps Karl Marx may have called it its "worth".

05:15.660 --> 05:24.420
But, this item of modern technology and industrialization was not on the market to be purchased in the

05:24.420 --> 05:38.500
year 1776. So the value of Â£50,000 could not buy you a tractor, or a combine-harvester, in

05:38.500 --> 05:48.580
the year 1776. Before the invention of tractors, the price

05:48.579 --> 05:57.259
of gold used to be measured in however many bushels of corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley,

05:57.259 --> 06:08.060
that it could be exchanged for on the market, at the market rate of exchange. But, after

06:08.060 --> 06:17.939
the propinquity of tractors within agriculture, the price of corn became much reduced.

06:17.939 --> 06:26.259
Latterly, much more corn could be swapped for the same amount of gold: assuming the price

06:26.259 --> 06:39.180
of gold to have been a constant throughout this time period. Although Smith is not 100%

06:39.180 --> 06:48.300
clear on this point, I define the value of an item to be the orchestration of the total

06:48.300 --> 06:57.780
amount of labour, by hand, or by machine, which is performed both to acquire the materials

06:57.780 --> 07:06.620
and tools for this object (and the labour performed upon it), and also the labour involved in trade

07:06.620 --> 07:13.259
and transportation in order to deliver this object to the precise location where the consumer

07:13.259 --> 07:28.259
can acquire it as his property. I think my definition is a pretty good one. In the following

07:28.259 --> 07:39.500
quotation from Gibbon, as a continuation of what he previously said, Gibbon refers to

07:39.500 --> 07:48.660
"its price", where "its price" is the price of any object. I quote: Its price must depend

07:48.660 --> 07:56.620
on the number of persons by whom it may be acquired and used; on the extent of the market;

07:56.620 --> 08:05.420
and consequently on the ease or difficulty of remote exportation, according to the nature

08:05.420 --> 08:18.340
of the commodity, its local situation, and the temporary circumstances of the world. (End quote)

08:18.340 --> 08:24.620
I agree again; and I also believe that this concise definition concurs with Smith's lengthier

08:24.620 --> 08:32.379
explanation about the same, which I may quote within the main body of this work (book 2: Extinction Avoidance).

08:33.340 --> 08:46.539
I was in the process of describing how the price of worn, clipped coin in the state of

08:46.539 --> 08:56.580
Hamburg may have borne an agio of 11 percent between that and the price of freshly-minted

08:56.580 --> 09:08.300
coin. Likewise, we can also describe an agio as, say, a 5% difference between the bank price

09:08.300 --> 09:19.340
of money, awarded by the Bank of Amsterdam, and the mint price of bullion. Let the bank

09:19.340 --> 09:30.340
price of money be 5% below the mint price of bullion, and let the market price of bullion

09:30.340 --> 09:46.300
be 2% lower than the mint price of bullion. Thus, within these circumstances where the

09:46.299 --> 09:57.500
mint price of bullion was 11.5% higher than the price of the clipped, worn, coin, the agio

09:57.500 --> 10:05.659
between the clipped, worn, coin and the market price of bullion will be 9.5%.

10:06.620 --> 10:20.219
Smith points out that for silver deposited in the form of Mexico dollars, where the fineness

10:20.219 --> 10:32.699
is known and ascertained, the bank will award a bank price as 22 guilders the mark: where a mark

10:32.940 --> 10:47.820
is a unit in weight. Juxtapose with this: the price of the newly-minted bullion, which was

10:47.820 --> 11:01.580
minted from those Mexico dollars, was 23 guilders per mark in weight. Thus, the bank price of money

11:01.580 --> 11:11.100
being lower than the market price of bullion, the bank would award a greater amount of guilders

11:11.100 --> 11:23.259
within bank credit than the bullion received as a deposit. It would appear that in the case of the

11:23.259 --> 11:32.220
Mexico dollar, the coin as a Mexico dollar was a form of bullion in itself of a very highly

11:32.220 --> 11:40.059
desirable worth, because its price was actually 2% or 3% higher than the mint price of bullion.

11:41.899 --> 11:47.819
I conclude that the Mexico dollar was a form of international currency which was more highly

11:47.820 --> 11:53.980
desirable in trade than the minted bullion from the city of Amsterdam.
