1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
Recall that the circulating capital of a society is composed of four parts, one provisions,

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:27,719
two materials, three finished work, and four money.

3
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:41,239
The first three: provisions, materials, and finished work, constitute consumable goods.

4
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:52,200
And whatever portion of consumable goods is not employed in maintaining the fixed capital

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:12,320
of a society, makes part of the neat revenue of the society: which is the stock of that

6
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:27,839
society which is reserved for immediate consumption. That is the viewpoint as taken by the point of

7
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:43,719
the view of society as a whole within a nation. Now I would like to talk about the circulating

8
00:01:43,719 --> 00:02:03,640
capital within any given enterprise. I will cite two examples: one involving hammers, and the second

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:16,920
example will involve timber being purchased by a house builder. In the former case, the hammers are

10
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:29,000
purchased by a type of enterprise which hammers small amounts of gold into gold leaf sheets of gold.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:42,639
Here the hammers form part of the provisions of that particular enterprise which hammers these

12
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:58,199
items of gold into thin gold leaf. Within the second example, the timber purchased by the house

13
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:12,039
builder from the timber merchant, constitutes part of the materials which he requires to build the

14
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:27,840
finished product. So, in the former case, the item purchased becomes part of the provisions; and in

15
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:38,799
the latter case, the item purchased becomes part of the materials. Recall that circulating capital

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:50,840
comprises provisions, materials, finished goods, and money. Recall also that when calculating the

17
00:03:50,840 --> 00:04:05,280
neat revenue we must only consider provisions, materials and finished goods, not money. We previously

18
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:16,279
defined the neat revenue to be the stock reserved for immediate consumption. But I would like to query

19
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:29,360
at what point the hammer becomes consumed. Is it at the point where it leaves the stock of finished

20
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:43,920
products at the hammer manufacture's location? Note that the enterprise which hammers gold leaf

21
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:59,439
does not consume, as part of its immediate consumption, the hammers, because these form part of the required

22
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:15,000
provisions which are necessary in order to perform this enterprise. The merchant does not consume his

23
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,600
stock because that would be bad accountancy. His circulating capital (quote) "...is totally excluded

24
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:41,960
from making any part of his neat revenue, which must consist altogether in his profits." (end quote).

25
00:05:41,959 --> 00:06:07,560
This means that out of his profits -- from his profits -- he acquires the component part of money which is to

26
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:24,680
be used for his immediate consumption. The hammers which ultimately formed part of the provisions of

27
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:41,160
the enterprise which hammered gold into gold leaf, did actually form part of the neat revenue of the society

28
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:57,720
to which the enterprise which manufactures hammers belongs. Although these hammers, when regarded as

29
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:15,000
part of the neat revenue of a society, become not consumed actually by the stock of any individual or

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,520
enterprise which is reserved for immediate consumption, they do become consumed in a sense, and so in this

31
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:38,279
regard, the neat revenue does comprehend the stock reserved for immediate consumption; but it also

32
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:52,439
comprehends provisions and materials as part of some further enterprise. This is the case when

33
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:08,839
regarded as the neat revenue of a society: but not as the neat revenue of an individual or an enterprise.

34
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:23,079
To cite the example of the house builder garnering timber from the timber merchant,

35
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:35,879
the house builder does not put the timber into his stock reserved for immediate consumption

36
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:49,639
because he does not consume this himself, and that would be incorrect accountancy anyway.

37
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:01,000
This timber does form part of the materials required to construct a house,

38
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,720
so we may say that the timber

39
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:25,720
forms part of the neat revenue of a society, but not that of the enterprise as this house builder.

40
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:40,920
Does a house become consumed when it is bought? Well in a way, yes; and in a way, no.

41
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:52,440
The house is an asset which if left uncared for will fall into dilapidation over time.

42
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,240
So, a house is an asset which degrades over time;

43
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,320
and so, in this sense, a house is a consumable commodity.

44
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:27,800
A punnet of strawberries is also a consumable commodity, which degrades pretty quickly:

45
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,560
a lot more quickly than a house does so.

46
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:44,359
So, a house is a much better asset than a lot of strawberries

47
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:52,519
because it retains its value, its worth -- its cost --

48
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:58,199
for much longer than the strawberries will.

49
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:07,479
So, a house can also be treated as an asset.

50
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,599
If I am in the strawberry merchant business,

51
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:24,199
strawberries, which I purchase as my materials for trade, are also an asset;

52
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,840
but these strawberries will perish

53
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:41,560
quite quickly. Unless I sell them on soon, I won't be able to recover my investment.

54
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:56,039
Though the timber in the timber-merchant's enterprise must by no means be placed within

55
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,919
the stock of the timber-merchant's which is reserved for his immediate consumption,

56
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,000
this timber

57
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,759
may be consumed by home buyers

58
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:28,759
whom replace the value of the timber to the timber merchant

59
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:39,000
together with profits upon this timber; and these home-buyers obtain

60
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:51,080
this acquisition from a revenue derived from other funds, such as their wages,

61
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,240
or the profits of their own enterprises:

62
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:06,519
and this replacing to the timber of the timber merchant

63
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:15,159
does not occasion any diminution either in the capital of the timber merchant,

64
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,840
nor the capital of the home buyer.

65
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,399
The reason why the capital of the home buyer is not decreased,

66
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:44,199
is because the house is being paid for out of profits of the home-buyer's enterprise,

67
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,759
or the home buyers wages.

68
00:13:48,759 --> 00:14:00,039
Money itself is an asset as a form of capital,

69
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:10,360
but it does not constitute capital revenue because capital revenue must be material tangible stuff:

70
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,559
such as the materials to work upon, or the finished products, or the fuel which is provided to the factory.

71
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:28,919
This is another revelation -- or should we say "heresy"?

72
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:45,159
I shall say that fixed capital, such as a factory owner's machinery,

73
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:56,120
is part of the set of provisions which this factory owner requires,

74
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:07,159
and in that sense these assets are part of the circulating capital.

75
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:21,719
Recall that circulating capital consists of: provisions, materials, finished goods, and money.

76
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:32,839
The reason why I include fixed capital, such as machinery, within

77
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:40,920
the provisions of the enterprise which the factory owner owns, is because

78
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:52,440
he might need to be provided with machinery which he pays for

79
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,560
out of his profits.

80
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:11,160
Recall that his profits may be spent upon maintaining his fixed capital,

81
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,560
such as maintaining his existing machinery or factory buildings,

82
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:29,080
or, in the alternative, his profits may be funnelled into his neat revenue:

83
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,480
which is his stock reserved for immediate consumption,

84
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,520
which is not part of the

85
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,639
provisions, materials, and finished products, of his enterprise.

86
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:56,279
When I say "his stock reserved for immediate consumption",

87
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:04,279
I mean: that which he purchases by using his neat revenue

88
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,200
in order to use these items himself, or give them to his friends.

89
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:31,080
Now, after he has built his factory and furnished it with productive machinery,

90
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:42,840
neither his factory nor his machinery constitutes part of the gross revenue

91
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:47,559
of his enterprise.

92
00:17:52,279 --> 00:18:01,399
This is because his gross revenue consists of that part of his provisions, materials,

93
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:09,480
and finished products, which are within flux: which are being exchanged.

94
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,799
He is keeping his factory. He is keeping his machinery.

95
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,759
He is not selling it on like a merchant of machinery would sell the machinery.

96
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:30,039
He is not in the business of constructing factories to sell them to other entrepreneurs.

97
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:39,559
He has acquired the assets as his factory and his machinery for the purpose of their use.

98
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,240
So it is what his machinery does,

99
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:56,200
and the actions which his labourers perform, which changes the materials

100
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:04,120
into the finished product, and of course he has to pay for the provisions as fuel and water

101
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,519
for his factory to function.

102
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,799
He also has to pay for the materials which his factory works upon, in order to create the finished

103
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:32,440
product. Fuel is provisions: and provisions in this sense -- the circulatory sense -- is part of his

104
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:39,559
circulating capital. His provisions in the fixed sense,

105
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,200
although part of his provisions, aren't circulating;

106
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:55,559
so these provisions such as machinery, and factories -- the buildings of --

107
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,200
are only paid for once,

108
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,279
and then exist as capital -- fixed capital -- assets.

109
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:26,440
But, the manufacturer of the machinery did sell his machinery when the factory owner bought it;

110
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:39,639
and so, in a sense, his machinery did become consumed when it became part of the provisions --

111
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,039
part of the fixed capital provisions -- of that factory owner.

112
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:51,319
So,

113
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,960
when the factory owner acquired these machinery,

114
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:09,960
this consumption did form part of the neat revenue of a society;

115
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,160
it didn't form part of the neat revenue of the factory owner.

116
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:31,880
The neat revenue of the factory owner was that part of his profits

117
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
which he spent upon stock reserved for his immediate consumption.

118
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,839
Here, the factory --

119
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:53,640
like a house -- is an asset, which is owned by the factory owner.

120
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:07,160
The factory, indeed, could be sold to another entrepreneur,

121
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:19,880
and in this sense, the factory itself constitutes part of the neat revenue of a society.

122
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,680
My definition of neat revenue of a society

123
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:42,040
is, "That part of revenue -- where revenue is tangible material stuff --

124
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:56,519
that people within that society have at their disposal to acquire as stock reserved for their

125
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:02,920
immediate consumption." Basically, how wealthy they are.

126
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,400
My definition of gross revenue

127
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,840
encompasses

128
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,000
all the circulating capital,

129
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,960
all the investment in fixed capital,

130
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,839
and all the neat revenue of all people within that society.

131
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,959
I concur with Smith when he says,

132
00:23:52,119 --> 00:24:03,319
"...so money, by means of which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among

133
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:10,279
all its different members, makes itself no part of that revenue."

134
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:25,319
This was the heresy I referred to earlier.

135
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:37,960
Smith said, "Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation,

136
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,439
the great instrument of commerce,

137
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,639
like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part,

138
00:24:51,960 --> 00:25:06,040
and a very valuable part, of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the society to which it belongs;

139
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:18,360
and though the metal pieces of which it is composed, in the course of their annual circulation,

140
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:26,039
distribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him,

141
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:32,439
they make themselves no part of that revenue."
