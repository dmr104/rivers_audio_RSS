00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When the King of France invaded Holland in 1672, the owners of bank money were keen to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,640
buy receipts at any price so they could bury the bullion in their gardens, after withdrawing

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,039
it from the Bank of Amsterdam.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,199
As a consequence of this calamity, every merchant found that in order to purchase receipts he,

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,719
or she, was required to spend a lot more, say, bushels of corn, or the worth of bushels of

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,119
corn, upon these receipts.

7
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:43,159
Say, previously, one gilder would exchange by 30 bushels of corn.

8
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:49,239
After this calamity, or during the calamity, one gilder may exchange for 300 bushels of

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:58,000
corn: that is one gilder in bank money.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Smith wrote, "The enemy, informed of the constitution of the bank, might even buy them [the receipts -ed] up in order

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,000
to prevent the carrying away of the treasure.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,439
In such emergencies, the bank, it is supposed, would break through its ordinary rule of making

13
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,760
payment only to the holders of receipts."

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:43,439
Smith continued, "The holders of receipts, who had no bank money, must have received within

15
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:56,000
2 or 3% of the value of the deposit for which their respective receipts had been granted."

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:07,799
Smith continued, "The bank, therefore, it is said, would in this case make no scruple of

17
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:17,079
paying, either with money or bullion, the full value of what the owners of bank money, who

18
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:22,400
could get no receipts, were credited for in its books;

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,039
paying, at the same time, 2 or 3% to such holders of receipts as had no bank money, that being

20
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:41,560
the whole value which, in this state of things, could justly be supposed due to them."

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:54,479
Further, Smith said, "In 1672, when the French king was at Utrecht, the bank of Amsterdam

22
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:08,799
paid so readily, as left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements.

23
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,280
Some of the pieces which were then brought from its repositories, appeared to have been

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:25,319
scorched with a fire which happened in the town-house soon after the bank was established.

25
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:37,120
Those pieces, therefore, must have lain there from that time."

26
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Smith again, "The Bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited with

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:55,599
it, but for every gilder for which it gives credit in its books, to keep in its repositories

28
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:05,439
the value of a gilder either in money or bullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money

29
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:13,759
or bullion for which there are receipts in force for which it is at all times liable to be called upon,

30
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:24,800
and which in reality is continually going from it, and returning to it again, cannot well be doubted."

31
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:34,800
And further, Smith said, "At Amsterdam, however, no point of faith is better established than that,

32
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:41,280
for every gilder circulated as bank money, there is a correspondent gilder

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
in gold or silver to be found in the treasures of the bank.

34
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
The city is guaranteed that it should be so."
