When the King of France invaded Holland in 1672, the owners of bank money were keen to

00:07.000 --> 00:12.640
buy receipts at any price so they could bury the bullion in their gardens, after withdrawing

00:12.640 --> 00:18.039
it from the Bank of Amsterdam.

00:18.039 --> 00:25.199
As a consequence of this calamity, every merchant found that in order to purchase receipts he,

00:25.199 --> 00:32.719
or she, was required to spend a lot more, say, bushels of corn, or the worth of bushels of

00:32.719 --> 00:35.119
corn, upon these receipts.

00:35.119 --> 00:43.159
Say, previously, one gilder would exchange by 30 bushels of corn.

00:43.159 --> 00:49.239
After this calamity, or during the calamity, one gilder may exchange for 300 bushels of

00:49.240 --> 00:58.000
corn: that is one gilder in bank money.

00:58.000 --> 01:09.200
Smith wrote, "The enemy, informed of the constitution of the bank, might even buy them [the receipts -ed] up in order

01:09.200 --> 01:16.000
to prevent the carrying away of the treasure.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.439
In such emergencies, the bank, it is supposed, would break through its ordinary rule of making

01:26.439 --> 01:32.760
payment only to the holders of receipts."

01:32.760 --> 01:43.439
Smith continued, "The holders of receipts, who had no bank money, must have received within

01:43.439 --> 01:56.000
2 or 3% of the value of the deposit for which their respective receipts had been granted."

01:56.000 --> 02:07.799
Smith continued, "The bank, therefore, it is said, would in this case make no scruple of

02:07.799 --> 02:17.079
paying, either with money or bullion, the full value of what the owners of bank money, who

02:17.079 --> 02:22.400
could get no receipts, were credited for in its books;

02:22.400 --> 02:32.039
paying, at the same time, 2 or 3% to such holders of receipts as had no bank money, that being

02:32.039 --> 02:41.560
the whole value which, in this state of things, could justly be supposed due to them."

02:41.560 --> 02:54.479
Further, Smith said, "In 1672, when the French king was at Utrecht, the bank of Amsterdam

02:54.479 --> 03:08.799
paid so readily, as left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements.

03:08.799 --> 03:15.280
Some of the pieces which were then brought from its repositories, appeared to have been

03:15.280 --> 03:25.319
scorched with a fire which happened in the town-house soon after the bank was established.

03:25.319 --> 03:37.120
Those pieces, therefore, must have lain there from that time."

03:37.400 --> 03:47.200
Smith again, "The Bank of Amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited with

03:47.200 --> 03:55.599
it, but for every gilder for which it gives credit in its books, to keep in its repositories

03:55.599 --> 04:05.439
the value of a gilder either in money or bullion. That it keeps in its repositories all the money

04:05.439 --> 04:13.759
or bullion for which there are receipts in force for which it is at all times liable to be called upon,

04:13.759 --> 04:24.800
and which in reality is continually going from it, and returning to it again, cannot well be doubted."

04:24.800 --> 04:34.800
And further, Smith said, "At Amsterdam, however, no point of faith is better established than that,

04:34.879 --> 04:41.280
for every gilder circulated as bank money, there is a correspondent gilder

04:42.000 --> 04:45.520
in gold or silver to be found in the treasures of the bank.

04:47.199 --> 04:50.720
The city is guaranteed that it should be so."
