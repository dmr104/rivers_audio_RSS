00:00.000 --> 00:09.700
I am the harbinger of economic prosperity, Long heft I forebeared, To bring about peace;

00:09.700 --> 00:17.120
and forebode Trust between brethren and kith; Not passage to degeneracy.

00:17.120 --> 00:22.640
I am the architect of a better tomorrow, I can see the past fore-told, To shine upon

00:22.640 --> 00:28.760
an archaic monolith. Besmote with feelings, kind and old.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.880
I am the wind of fortunes passing, I am the kind of smiling, laughing.

00:34.880 --> 00:40.120
I shall be kind to little old ladies, Telling me stories of ever-so old.

00:40.120 --> 00:46.600
I was not before the arcane angels, I was in better to bring about fortune. I am an

00:46.600 --> 00:53.240
apple-seed grazing in past-time, Indigo fortune of ever-so old.

00:53.240 --> 01:00.000
Ladies and footmen and fortunes and passing, Inter-twine features of pastures and laughing.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.939
I see the angels with myriad faces, Intestine feelings of interlaced spaces. Voters, and

01:05.939 --> 01:13.599
coasters, and railway sleepers, Dreary believers of myriad stations.

01:13.599 --> 01:20.520
National heroes and nationalist graces, Are enmity to our saviour-faces.

01:20.519 --> 01:23.879
Are you incumbent upon our noble races?

01:23.879 --> 01:28.199
Are you insiders of indigo spaces?

01:28.199 --> 01:36.280
Voters are not avoidant of laughter. Wisdom shall not be banished hereafter.

01:36.280 --> 01:43.239
My insiders are never without though, Eating that apple that I never let grow.

01:43.239 --> 01:50.599
Beaten brows and beaten frowns, Shall ne'er let the saviour crown, His horse to be dead of

01:50.599 --> 01:54.959
course, Nor kingdom to be heard of hoarse.

01:54.959 --> 02:01.319
My nonchalance pose and my broken throws, Shall mimic the apes of discourse; and toes To be

02:01.319 --> 02:07.519
upon the party-line, which Shall be towed, like trawlers cold.

02:07.519 --> 02:10.759
I say, what does all this mean?

02:10.759 --> 02:14.159
I say, did Jack eat that bean?

02:14.159 --> 02:16.560
When shall the future be here?

02:16.560 --> 02:20.120
Whence shall the saviour-face appear?

02:20.120 --> 02:22.719
Who shall not that very angel be?

02:22.719 --> 02:25.479
Who is alive, and who is free?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.000
Not the craven, nor the dead.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.199
To progress, shall we put our bed: Our homestead raven, our property, Our slaves to freedom,

02:34.199 --> 02:41.879
our enmity, To change, the presage of the past; Not futures known, nor even cast.

02:41.879 --> 02:47.119
I am the bard, now follow me. Emancipation. Liberty.

02:47.119 --> 02:53.159
The knee shall grow; The slaves are gone. The sun shine forth to evening song.

02:53.159 --> 03:00.599
The mistakes are yet made by man, Who can be blind to his every can. Or can't, not knowing

03:00.599 --> 03:07.359
what to do. If evening comes, I'll be anew, To porridge of the idle soup, Not ever-more

03:07.359 --> 03:10.000
in an awful loop.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.959
Just read. Just let the words ring true. Just be like me. Just see it through!
