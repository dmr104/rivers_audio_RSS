00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Introduction part two, the psychology of money.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.400
I shall adumbrate that when the price of money is considered in the modern world, the psychology

00:18.400 --> 00:26.960
of this evaluation leads to an inverted understanding where the hidden reality will exist behind

00:26.960 --> 00:34.240
our backs and be quite opposite to that which we think we understand.

00:34.240 --> 00:41.120
I am going to use three concepts: price, cost and worth.

00:41.120 --> 00:48.000
I shall first follow an understanding of the 20th century viewpoint of the word "price",

00:48.000 --> 00:52.760
that of "cost" and that of "worth".

00:52.759 --> 01:02.439
I shall show how any of these concepts differed in Adam Smith's day from the present moment.

01:02.439 --> 01:07.120
I shall define a few things here now.

01:07.120 --> 01:15.759
If I have ten apples, then the price of ten apples in apples is, well, ten apples.

01:15.759 --> 01:22.239
The cost of ten apples is ten apples, and the worth of ten apples is ten apples.

01:22.239 --> 01:30.719
Likewise, if I have £100 in money, the price of this money is £100, the cost of this money

01:30.719 --> 01:41.280
is £100, and the worth of this money is £100. No problem so far.

01:41.280 --> 01:57.319
Here, I have implicitly defined the cost of apples in apples, and the worth of apples in apples.

01:57.319 --> 02:09.680
Now, imagine a see-saw, or in America a teeter-totter. At the centre pivot is a label, and that label

02:09.680 --> 02:20.360
says "price". On the left-hand side, as we view the see-saw, is ten apples.

02:20.360 --> 02:27.120
On the right-hand side of the see-saw is £1, in money.

02:27.120 --> 02:39.000
So, we can say that the price of ten apples was £1: "was" because it shall change in a moment.

02:39.000 --> 02:53.879
Now, the price of apples doubles. So, now ten apples cost £2.

02:53.879 --> 02:59.920
Previously, ten apples were worth £1.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.800
Now, after the transformation, ten apples are worth £2.

03:04.800 --> 03:12.960
What was a ratio of apples to money of one-to-one has now become a ratio of apples to

03:12.960 --> 03:17.320
money of one to two.

03:17.320 --> 03:23.800
What was a one to one ratio, if ten apples can be considered as one unit, and one pound

03:23.800 --> 03:29.800
can be considered as one unit, has now become a one-to-two ratio.

03:29.800 --> 03:34.439
Draw a table please.

03:34.439 --> 03:43.439
We have on the columns, apples then money, going from left to right. And in the rows, we have

03:43.439 --> 03:49.640
apples and money, going top to bottom.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.360
This is a table of price.

03:53.360 --> 04:07.160
Now, we've evaluated the ratio of apples to money as one-to-two: which is after the transformation.

04:07.160 --> 04:22.480
Please write in the north-east cell of the table, the transformed ratio as one-to-two.

04:22.480 --> 04:30.560
Now, let us consider what happens if we put money on the left side of the see-saw, and apples

04:30.560 --> 04:36.840
on the right side of the see-saw. The central pivot still has a label that says price.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.560
So, we are basically inverting what we are doubling.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.480
So, previously we doubled the price of apples; now we double the price of money.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.480
But, wait a minute, you might be saying: the price of money doesn't make any sense, because

04:51.480 --> 04:56.840
the price of money has to be evaluated in money. But I said the Universe will exist

04:56.840 --> 04:59.360
behind our backs.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.960
I say the exchangeable price is however much it will swap for, of any commodity: in this

05:03.960 --> 05:08.840
case it's apples.

05:08.840 --> 05:16.120
But the 20th century psychological viewpoint does not concur with this, my viewpoint, when

05:16.120 --> 05:21.000
we consider the price of money.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.120
Our erstwhile condition, which is our previous set of circumstances, is that the one pound

05:29.120 --> 05:36.959
will exchange for ten apples. So, the exchangeable amount of money is one pound, and this will

05:36.959 --> 05:48.160
swap by ten apples on the market previously.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.080
By the 20th-century viewpoint, when the price of money doubles, this infers that the amount

05:55.080 --> 06:01.600
of money required doubles.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.160
Money doubles.

06:03.160 --> 06:11.200
So, now, two pounds will exchange for ten apples. This is the same as saying that one pound

06:11.199 --> 06:18.159
of money will exchange for five apples.

06:18.159 --> 06:24.519
This is because the ten apples will now cost two pounds.

06:24.519 --> 06:32.159
So, if I have one pound, which will exchange for ten apples, and the price of this one pound

06:32.160 --> 06:43.120
doubles, then one pound will exchange for five apples, because two pounds will exchange

06:43.120 --> 06:44.960
for ten.

06:44.960 --> 06:51.920
It is the exchangeable price of this pound which has risen.

06:51.920 --> 06:58.040
More of it will be required: more pounds will be required to exchange for the commodity,

06:58.040 --> 07:01.240
which is apples, than before.

07:01.240 --> 07:14.199
So, one pound has just transformed to two pounds, where the units of apples remains the same.

07:14.199 --> 07:21.120
I really must stress again that this is the 20th century viewpoint about what happens

07:21.120 --> 07:28.000
by a change in the price of money.

07:28.000 --> 07:35.079
It does not concur with the 18th-century viewpoint.

07:35.079 --> 07:46.720
So in the south-west cell of our price table, we have a ratio of two-to-one: that is two

07:46.720 --> 07:55.680
units of money to one units of apple.

07:55.680 --> 08:04.720
Recall that in the north-east cell of the table, we had one unit of apple to two units

08:04.720 --> 08:07.759
of money.

08:07.759 --> 08:18.600
So far, our table is syntactically inconsistent. But it doesn't matter what we pay in, we get

08:18.600 --> 08:24.720
the same result.

08:24.720 --> 08:32.360
We are dealing with exchangeable amounts.

08:32.360 --> 08:43.000
If I have a Rolex watch, the price of which I am selling for twenty thousand pounds. And

08:43.000 --> 08:53.519
if I have four hundred Casio watches, the price of which each is fifty pounds.

08:53.519 --> 09:02.960
And if I now abandon money altogether, and use a direct bartering scheme, I may swap four

09:02.960 --> 09:16.319
hundred of my Casio watches for one of your Rolex watches.

09:16.320 --> 09:30.080
Now, if the price of my Rolex watch increases, then fewer Rolex watches will swap by four

09:30.080 --> 09:37.440
hundred Casio watches: which is the same thing as saying that more Casio watches will swap

09:37.440 --> 09:48.080
by one Rolex watch.

09:48.080 --> 09:55.920
Returning to the evaluation in terms of money, if your Rolex watch has transformed in price

09:55.920 --> 10:03.000
from twenty thousand pounds to thirty thousand pounds, then, after this transformation, it will

10:03.000 --> 10:11.320
swap by six hundred of my fifty pound Casio watches.

10:11.320 --> 10:19.600
Now, let us call your Rolex ten apples.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.919
What is in a name?

10:22.919 --> 10:27.779
Would not a rose by any other name still smell as sweet?

10:27.779 --> 10:31.759
It doesn't matter what we call the variable.

10:31.759 --> 10:43.439
Ten apples is one unit -- is the name for one Rolex as one unit.

10:43.439 --> 10:57.399
And let my four hundred Casio's be called "one pound" as a unit. Thus, if the price of

10:57.399 --> 11:11.639
your ten apples doubles, it will now exchange by two pounds of money.

11:11.639 --> 11:23.279
The ratio as the amounts has transformed from a ratio of one-to-one into a ratio of one

11:23.279 --> 11:36.039
-to-two, where the apples were placed on the left-hand side of the see-saw.

11:36.039 --> 11:38.639
No problem so far.

11:38.639 --> 11:55.960
Now, let your Rolex be called one pound in money. And let my four hundred Casios be

11:55.960 --> 12:02.240
called "ten apples".

12:02.240 --> 12:16.480
When your Rolex doubles in price, it requires more Casios to exchange by it:

12:16.480 --> 12:20.360
it requires eight hundred Casios.

12:20.360 --> 12:31.840
But wait a minute. Your Rolex was called "one pound". So, surely, if one pound would double

12:31.840 --> 12:44.840
in price, then it would require twenty apples to be exchanged for it by the eighteenth-century

12:44.840 --> 13:01.000
viewpoint; not five apples to be exchanged for it by the twentieth-century viewpoint.

13:01.000 --> 13:11.240
This viewpoint is non-intuitive to the modern interpretation.

13:11.240 --> 13:18.039
What I am saying is that by the eighteenth-century viewpoint, the price of a commodity

13:18.039 --> 13:29.159
is the amount of something else which will exchange by this commodity.

13:29.159 --> 13:40.519
The mistake we made was to say that when the price of money doubles, the amount of money

13:40.519 --> 13:50.839
becomes transformed into itself doubling.

13:50.840 --> 13:58.519
By the eighteenth-century viewpoint, when the price of money doubles, the amount of

13:58.519 --> 14:13.680
money becomes transformed by itself halving.

14:13.679 --> 14:21.939
Because the twentieth-century -- or is it the twenty-first century (?) -- point of view, is inconsistent,

14:21.939 --> 14:28.879
We know it's incorrect.

14:28.879 --> 14:37.059
Depending on where we place money -- is it on the left-hand side of the see-saw, or is apples

14:37.059 --> 14:43.979
on the left-hand side of the see-saw (?) -- we get a different result.

14:43.979 --> 14:51.139
We know that Adam Smith was correct because he's logically consistent.

14:51.139 --> 14:58.899
The same format as the price table by the eighteenth-century viewpoint has the transformed

14:58.899 --> 15:07.419
ratio of one-to-two in the north-east cell, and the transformed ratio of one-to-two in

15:07.419 --> 15:13.419
the south-west cell.

15:13.419 --> 15:21.620
The semantic meaning of the word as money does not alter the syntax of this table.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.100
It does not alter the syntactical meaning.

15:25.100 --> 15:33.340
The table is syntactically consistent in the eighteenth century.

15:33.340 --> 15:38.379
This ends my discussion about the word as price.
