00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I will first explain the 18th century viewpoint before the 20th century viewpoint.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
This is because the 18th century viewpoint has no ambiguities within it.

00:12.000 --> 00:23.000
Within the 20th century viewpoint, ideas and semantics about the word as "worth" alter, and vary,

00:23.000 --> 00:34.000
the relationship of the transformation of when the worth of a specific item happens to become doubled.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
Now, I shall expatiate upon the word as "worth".

00:41.000 --> 00:57.000
Put ten apples on the left-hand side of a see-saw; and put money, one pound of money, on the right-hand side of this see-saw.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
Let the worth of these ten apples be one pound.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
This worth of apples doubles.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
The worth of these apples is now two pounds.

01:24.000 --> 01:41.000
Draw a table, as you did before, where apples and money are from left to right, in the columns, and apples and money are from top to bottom, in the rows.

01:41.000 --> 02:02.000
We have just calculated the one-to-one ratio has become transformed to a one-to-two ratio in the north-east cell.

02:02.000 --> 02:14.000
Let us find out what the transformation is in the south-west cell.

02:14.000 --> 02:31.000
To do this, we put one pound of money on the left-hand side of the see-saw, and we put ten apples on the right-hand side of the see-saw.

02:31.000 --> 02:45.000
We say that, before the transformation, the worth of one pound is ten apples. Now, the worth of one pound doubles.

02:45.000 --> 03:00.000
By the eighteenth century viewpoint, the worth of one pound is now twenty apples.

03:00.000 --> 03:13.000
So, a one-to-one ratio has become transformed into a one-to-two ratio. This is in the south-west cell.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
We see that this table is syntactically consistent: has not been inconsistent;

03:21.000 --> 03:34.000
the transformation is symmetrical, irregardless of which item is on the left side of the see-saw.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
So, what is this eighteenth century concept as "worth"?

03:39.000 --> 04:01.000
Well, I suspect that it is the inter-play between one person's demand for an item, and the reluctance on behalf of the owner to part with this item.

04:02.000 --> 04:14.000
The twentieth century concept of worth; at least, the latter half of the twentieth century concept of worth,

04:14.000 --> 04:26.000
becomes invested with emotional artistic expression, inspiration, time and effort.

04:26.000 --> 04:42.000
In the eighteenth century, "worth" pertained to something extrinsic, such as the inter-play between my demand, and your reluctance to part with the item:

04:42.000 --> 04:55.000
specified the amount of money which would be agreed to be parted with upon purchasing such an item.

04:55.000 --> 05:11.000
I recall from Nelson Mandela's autobiographical book, The Long Walk to Freedom, how journalistic inquiries had changed when he was released from prison,

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
in comparison to when he went to prison.

05:17.000 --> 05:37.000
He said that, later, people talked about feelings and emotions; whereas prior, in the twentieth century, people talked about facts, and the case.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
I have, this far, deliberately avoided using the word as "value".

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
I will use this word later in the text, but not yet.

05:51.000 --> 06:07.000
What I am doing is defining concepts, axioms, and postulates, linguistically, and developing theorems based upon these definitions, axioms, and postulates;

06:07.000 --> 06:22.000
although I am not as rigorous as Euclid was, in the way I present my material.

06:22.000 --> 06:32.000
The twentieth century concept of the word as "worth" is very much addled.

06:32.000 --> 06:50.000
To illustrate this point, if we place money on the left side of the see-saw, and ten apples on the right, and we ask: when the one pound of money doubles in worth,

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
how many apples will it then exchange for (?),

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
one person might say five; another person might say twenty.

07:06.000 --> 07:16.000
One person might say five, and then changes mind, and subsequently says twenty.

07:16.000 --> 07:32.000
The third person might say: well, if the worth of one pound doubles, then one pound is now worth two pounds, and two pounds can now purchase twenty apples;

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
so, one pound can still only purchase ten.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
We actually have three answers for this question:

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
we have, no change in the ratio;

07:44.000 --> 07:53.000
we have, a transformation of a change of two-to-one; and we have a transformation of a change of one-to-two.

07:53.000 --> 08:06.000
Please note that the transformation of the ratio into one-to-two was the same as the eighteenth century concept.

08:11.000 --> 08:21.000
Alternatively, if we put apples on the left side of the see-saw, and money on the right, and say that the worth of ten apples doubles:

08:21.000 --> 08:30.000
how many pounds can be had in exchange for ten apples subsequently (?);

08:30.000 --> 08:48.000
people sometimes infer that ten apples will exchange for fifty pence, and sometimes they infer that ten apples will subsequently exchange for two pounds.

08:48.000 --> 08:57.000
There is no agreement upon the word as "worth" in the twenty-first century:

08:57.000 --> 09:08.000
at least, in the beginning of the twenty-first century, I should add.

09:08.000 --> 09:19.000
It is as though the person in the twenty-first century, may assume that the worth of something is the amount of it:

09:19.000 --> 09:33.000
the quantity of apples on the left-hand side, or the quantity of money on the left-hand side.

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
Likewise, another person or, indeed, the same person, upon changing his or her mind, in the twenty-first century,

09:41.000 --> 09:55.000
may equally infer that the word as "worth" refers to a transformation of one-to-one into one-to-two.

09:55.000 --> 10:10.000
Here, the person is inferring that worth is something extrinsic to the object in question, i.e. not the amount of it,

10:10.000 --> 10:22.000
but the amount of something that one may exchange it by.

10:22.000 --> 10:36.000
And in doing so, this person, who I shall refer to as "one", is using the eighteenth century viewpoint.

10:36.000 --> 10:46.000
One may use the eighteenth century viewpoint, or one may not.

10:46.000 --> 11:10.000
If not, one may infer no change at all, or one may infer a one-to-one ratio becoming transformed into a two-to-one ratio, left-hand side to right-hand side.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Within the twenty-first century, the semantic meaning of the word as "worth" is unclear:

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
it may be one thing, but then again, it may be a contradictory thing.  So, the word itself is broken,

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
because it doesn't actually mean anything grammatically, syntactically, or semantically:

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
because the semantics will change the syntax of its meaning.

11:36.000 --> 11:47.000
Like many of the prepositions, its semantics is chaotic, and is fundamentally broken.

11:47.000 --> 12:02.000
To deprive somebody of language is a terrible event; and because different people don't agree on the meaning of words themselves,

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
the language itself has achieved a state of deprivation towards the general populace in the English-speaking world:

12:11.000 --> 12:22.000
I believe at this present time.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Here ends my discussion about the word as "worth".
