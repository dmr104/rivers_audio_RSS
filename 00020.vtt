Introduction Part 5 The Amazonian Rainforest and the Balance of Trade

00:14.240 --> 00:22.240
I don't like to point this out to you, but John Maynard Keynes based his ideas upon those

00:22.240 --> 00:28.960
of an obscure book by Hobson and Mummery,

00:29.040 --> 00:38.080
the ideology of which is to prevent individuals saving capital by taking it off them in taxes

00:38.080 --> 00:41.840
if they do.

00:41.840 --> 00:49.680
These ideas of political economy are manifest within the tax system of 2024, and have been

00:49.680 --> 00:56.760
ever since Keynes' diatribe infiltrated the collective consciousness of people who create

00:56.760 --> 01:04.320
governmental policies about taxation.

01:04.320 --> 01:19.200
As a consequence of Keynes, the majority of modern economists have anxious ideas about

01:19.360 --> 01:27.400
money gravitating towards the location of where stock is.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.440
They call this the "balance of trade":

01:31.440 --> 01:40.080
how much money leaves the nation through importation to that nation, and how much money enters the

01:40.080 --> 01:47.680
country through exportation from that country.

01:47.680 --> 02:03.440
I say these ideas are misfounded, and have caused the destruction of the Amazonian Rainforest.

02:03.440 --> 02:16.400
I paraphrase from Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chapter 2, "Of Restraints upon Importation".

02:16.400 --> 02:24.520
When the necessaries of life have become taxed in any country, it becomes proper, some

02:24.520 --> 02:35.280
people pretend, to tax not only the like necessaries of life imported from other countries, but

02:35.280 --> 02:43.080
all sorts of foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the

02:43.080 --> 02:47.280
produce of domestic industry.

02:47.280 --> 03:02.000
Subsistence, these people say, becomes necessarily dearer in consequence of such taxes:

03:02.000 --> 03:11.840
:such taxes as taxes upon domestically produced commodities.

03:11.840 --> 03:22.680
"They", in Adam Smith's time, have understood this one correctly.

03:23.520 --> 03:40.520
And the price of labour must always rise with the price of the labourer's subsistence.

03:40.520 --> 03:45.960
Again this statement is true.

03:45.960 --> 03:55.880
Every commodity, therefore, which is the produce of domestic industry, though not immediately

03:55.880 --> 04:06.240
taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes, because the labour which produces

04:06.240 --> 04:11.920
it becomes so.

04:12.880 --> 04:27.680
True again, though this is really not readily perceived by policy makers today, i.e. as the cost of

04:27.680 --> 04:37.440
living rises, so does the cost of labour, because this increase in the cost of living,

04:37.440 --> 04:49.120
which is the result of taxes upon produced commodities, has to be passed on to the price

04:49.120 --> 05:01.760
at which all domestically produced commodities are sold.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.400
Note that domestic labour is required to produce domestically produced commodities.

05:10.400 --> 05:22.400
Smith was talking about inflation before the word was invented.

05:22.400 --> 05:28.800
In order to put domestic upon the same footing with foreign industry, therefore, it becomes

05:28.800 --> 05:40.960
necessary, the misguided people think, to lay some duty, which is a taxation, upon every

05:40.960 --> 05:51.080
foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities with

05:51.080 --> 05:53.600
which it can come into competition.

05:59.600 --> 06:12.600
i.e. the misguided people have built a monetary house of cards upon the following proposition,

06:12.600 --> 06:22.760
which is: the likes of malt tariffs on domestically produced malt causes inflation, which is bad

06:22.760 --> 06:27.040
for all domestic industry.

06:27.280 --> 06:33.120
So, the misguided people think, to counteract this, the government should increase its revenues

06:33.120 --> 06:39.920
by increasing duties on everything imported from abroad, wine, candles, silk, cotton,

06:39.920 --> 06:50.520
silver, etc.  But, in truth, this increases the price of living further, as vineyards

06:50.680 --> 06:58.440
in Scotland are not as favourably climatised as those in France; and so people of Scotland

06:58.440 --> 07:05.800
are prevented from buying French wine, most probably of a superior quality, at its cheaper

07:05.800 --> 07:08.480
price.

07:08.480 --> 07:16.680
When the price of living increases, this has the most visible effect of requiring the government

07:16.680 --> 07:24.560
to pay a higher amount of individual wages to public servants to meet this price of living

07:24.560 --> 07:35.160
increase, which requires more revenues, which, if not in the form as PET, personal expenditure

07:35.160 --> 07:41.680
tax, increase the price of living further.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
This is a vicious circle.

07:46.680 --> 07:53.120
Further, individuals can save less when the price of living is higher, resulting in fewer

07:53.120 --> 08:09.040
savings, hence less capital gains, hence less money to invest in stock, hence both fewer

08:09.040 --> 08:13.880
people employed by working upon this stock --

08:13.880 --> 08:22.320
this is what unemployment is -- and also as a consequence of this reduction in stock,

08:22.320 --> 08:32.160
failure of competition, impaired markets, and larger firms buying out or out-competing

08:32.160 --> 08:40.080
smaller enterprises: which is a parody of, and a perversion of, the way the world ought

08:40.080 --> 08:43.400
to be.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.920
In the Victorian era, the poet Stephen Crane wrote,

08:48.920 --> 09:00.440
God fashioned the ship of the world carefully. With the infinite skill of an all-master

09:00.440 --> 09:04.280
Made He the hull and the sails.

09:04.280 --> 09:09.560
Held He the rudder, ready for adjustment.

09:09.560 --> 09:15.960
Erect stood he, scanning his work proudly.

09:15.960 --> 09:25.680
Then -- at fateful time -- a wrong called, and God turned heeding.

09:25.680 --> 09:35.640
Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly, Making cunning noiseless travel down

09:35.640 --> 09:39.440
the ways.

09:39.440 --> 09:49.400
So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas, Going ridiculous voyages, Making

09:49.400 --> 10:01.000
quaint progress, Turning as with serious purpose, Before stupid winds.

10:01.000 --> 10:24.440
And there were many in the sky Who laughed at this thing. I now quote from Wealth of Nations, book 4, chapter 3, part 2.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.840
When two places trade with one another,

10:28.840 --> 10:39.720
this doctrine, end quote, of the balance of trade, quote, supposes that, if the balance

10:39.720 --> 10:50.880
be even, neither of them loses or gains; but, if it leans in any degree to one side, that

10:50.880 --> 11:00.640
one of them loses and the other gains, in proportion to its declension from the exact

11:00.640 --> 11:05.640
equilibrium.

11:05.640 --> 11:14.640
Both suppositions are false.

11:14.640 --> 11:28.560
End quote, I quote, Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of

11:28.560 --> 11:38.140
the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other

11:38.140 --> 11:46.620
regulations of commerce, are founded.

11:46.620 --> 11:51.780
End quote.

11:51.780 --> 12:01.220
Those restraints being, the extraordinary restraints laid upon the importation of goods

12:01.220 --> 12:18.660
from other countries, with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous.

12:18.660 --> 12:22.140
The following is true:

12:22.140 --> 12:37.060
I quote, If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist altogether

12:37.060 --> 12:48.100
in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon most occasions, not only both

12:48.100 --> 12:59.940
gain, but they will gain equally or very nearly equally;

12:59.940 --> 13:17.020
each will, in this case, afford a market for a part of the surplus produce of the other;

13:17.020 --> 13:27.140
each will replace a capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for the

13:27.140 --> 13:38.860
market this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been distributed

13:38.860 --> 13:55.540
among, and given revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants.

13:55.540 --> 14:01.780
End quote.

14:01.780 --> 14:14.740
Recall that capital is material tangible stuff, or, in the form of money, it is the

14:14.740 --> 14:33.300
worth of the money, i.e. the amount of material tangible stuff the money will exchange by.

14:33.300 --> 14:45.340
Let us just say, 17% of the Scotch production of whisky is exported exclusively to France,

14:45.340 --> 14:59.980
which in turn exports 41% of its wine production exclusively to Scotland; and that this 17%

14:59.980 --> 15:11.460
of whisky will exchange for the same amount of stuff that 41% of the wine production of

15:11.460 --> 15:21.460
France will exchange for.

15:21.460 --> 15:31.220
This 17% of the production of Scotch whisky, which is exported from Scotland, does not find

15:31.220 --> 15:39.700
a home market within Scotland, because the Scottish population have only a requirement

15:39.700 --> 15:50.420
for the purchase and consumption of a finite number of gallons of whisky each year.

15:50.420 --> 16:01.260
This is called the absolute demand:

16:01.260 --> 16:06.820
it is what they would like to have.

16:06.820 --> 16:11.500
They may wish to have no more than this.

16:11.500 --> 16:18.540
If I have six suits in my wardrobe and somebody offers me a high-quality suit on discount,

16:19.540 --> 16:24.980
I may wish to buy it because it is of better quality than my existing suits.

16:24.980 --> 16:31.420
But if the suit on offer is of the same quality, I am likely to say, "Sorry, but I already have

16:31.420 --> 16:40.860
six suits, and I have no space for one more.

16:40.860 --> 16:48.340
The same is true pertaining to the home market by the consumption of whisky in Scotland,

16:48.340 --> 16:57.020
and the home market by the consumption of wine within France.

16:57.020 --> 17:03.300
The home market may require, if it can afford to buy, and assuming it can afford to buy,

17:03.300 --> 17:11.860
so much, and no more, whisky, or wine.

17:11.860 --> 17:21.220
Obviously, wine is not produced in Scotland due to climate reasons.

17:21.220 --> 17:29.020
So it must be imported to Scotland instead.

17:29.020 --> 17:35.740
Without this exchange of actual commodities between France and Scotland, there would be

17:35.740 --> 17:45.740
less industry performed in France: less stock upon which the industry is performed, more

17:45.740 --> 17:57.500
unemployment, and less gold would be attracted to this non-augmented industry -- where industry

17:57.500 --> 18:02.460
is work, or meaningful labour.

18:02.460 --> 18:09.580
Scottish people, having a demand for wine, would not be able to get hold of it, thus

18:09.580 --> 18:25.580
creating a market for, perhaps, smugglers, to smuggle this wine as contraband to Scotland.

18:25.740 --> 18:35.500
The French, deprived of their natural liberty, would be unable to acquire Scotch whisky;

18:35.500 --> 18:42.820
and this, in turn, would deprive Scotland from being able to augment its stock in provisions, materials,

18:42.820 --> 18:50.460
and finished goods, pertaining to the whisky industry.

18:50.460 --> 18:59.620
Thus, their industry would be non-augmented, and money, being less attracted to this non-augmented

18:59.620 --> 19:06.900
industry within Scotland, would flow out of Scotland as foreign investments become apparent

19:06.900 --> 19:19.580
and more lucrative elsewhere.

19:19.580 --> 19:29.100
Let me repeat these last words I quoted from Book 4, Chapter 3, Part 2.

19:29.100 --> 19:36.860
Each place will replace a capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for

19:36.860 --> 19:44.580
the market this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been distributed

19:44.580 --> 19:59.060
among, and given revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants.

19:59.060 --> 20:10.700
"Given revenue to the wages people in the Scotch whisky industry get paid" affords them

20:10.940 --> 20:20.220
clothes, affords them houses, and affords them the ability, or it ought to, to save:

20:20.220 --> 20:33.900
to generate their own worth of money which can be used as capital within their own enterprises.

20:33.980 --> 20:42.460
I quote, Some part of the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their

20:42.460 --> 20:47.260
revenue and maintenance from the other.

20:47.260 --> 21:04.380
end quote, i.e. the workers within the Scotch whisky industry will derive their capabilities

21:04.380 --> 21:15.180
to acquire the necessaries and luxuries of the price of living by the consumption within

21:15.180 --> 21:30.300
France of 17% of the total production of whisky within Scotland.

21:30.300 --> 21:43.980
Adam Smith continued, As the commodities exchanged, too, are supposed to be of equal value,

21:43.980 --> 21:54.820
so the two capitals employed in the trade will, upon most occasions, be equal, or very

21:54.820 --> 22:07.180
nearly equal; and both being employed in raising the native commodities of the two countries,

22:07.260 --> 22:15.660
the revenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will

22:15.660 --> 22:23.100
be equal, or very nearly equal.

22:23.100 --> 22:33.820
This revenue and maintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or smaller, in proportion

22:33.820 --> 22:45.420
to the extent of their dealings. If these should annually amount to £100,000, for example,

22:45.420 --> 22:57.100
or to £1,000,000, on each side, each of them will afford an annual revenue, in the one case

22:57.180 --> 23:08.620
of £100,000, and, in the other, of £1,000,000, to the inhabitants of the other.

23:13.900 --> 23:21.340
End quote. As an aside, the expression one millions,

23:21.340 --> 23:29.580
where millions is in plural, was the correct way of speaking back then.
