00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Within my 1904 edition of Wealth of Nations, published by Grant Richards, 48 Leicester Square,

00:12.000 --> 00:26.320
London, there is a transcription error, which does not concur with the Ward, Locke & Company,

00:26.320 --> 00:38.520
New York, Bond Street edition, with notes by J. R. McCulloch.

00:38.520 --> 00:47.719
Within the Grant Richards edition is referred to the "introductive powers of labour".

00:47.719 --> 00:57.320
Within the Ward, Locke & Co edition, this is the "productive powers of labour".

00:57.320 --> 01:05.819
The latter makes more sense, because the former don't.

01:05.819 --> 01:14.259
I don't have at hand, or access to, one of the first editions of Adam Smith's Wealth

01:14.260 --> 01:23.719
of Nations to check which word is correct, but I predict that "productive powers of labour"

01:23.719 --> 01:27.380
is accurate.

01:27.380 --> 01:32.800
This pertains to the following quote from Book 2, Chapter 2, Of Money.

01:32.800 --> 01:41.200
"...the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which compose the fixed capital,

01:41.640 --> 01:55.920
bear this further resemblance to that part of the circulating capital which consists in money;

01:55.920 --> 02:05.420
that as every saving in the expence of erecting and supporting those machines,

02:05.620 --> 02:19.819
which does not diminish the productive powers of labour, is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society;

02:19.819 --> 02:26.819
so every saving in the expence of collecting and supporting that part of the circulating capital

02:26.819 --> 02:35.120
which consists in money is an improvement of exactly the same kind." (end quote).

02:35.520 --> 02:54.319
This is an inference to the effect of: as an equally good tractor, if not a better one, might be bought for the same price,

02:54.519 --> 03:05.919
likewise, the advancement in systems of banking, which reduce the expenses for these banking services,

03:05.919 --> 03:13.719
e.g. electronic banking making bank clerks redundant --

03:13.719 --> 03:26.020
just like when the farmer purchases an equal quality tractor by a cheaper price;

03:26.020 --> 03:43.120
when costs are reduced within the banking systems, banking services become cheaper,

03:43.120 --> 03:55.520
and this enables businesses which use those banking services to be more efficient,

03:55.520 --> 04:03.219
as their costs will be less for using these banking services.

04:03.219 --> 04:12.420
With fewer expenses by more efficient and cheaper banking services,

04:12.419 --> 04:27.919
the previous expense for the factory owner in banking might become converted to profit for himself or his shareholders.

04:27.919 --> 04:32.919
Within the same chapter Smith said,

04:32.920 --> 04:39.120
"The substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money,

04:39.120 --> 04:51.319
replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and sometimes equally convenient." (end quote).

04:51.319 --> 04:59.219
He said,

04:59.219 --> 05:05.719
"There are several different sorts of paper money;

05:05.719 --> 05:14.219
but the circulating notes of banks and bankers are the species which is best known,

05:14.220 --> 05:24.720
and which seems best adapted for this purpose." (end quote).

05:24.720 --> 05:39.120
When Smith says, "this purpose", he means that something expensive, such as transactions of gold and silver,

05:39.120 --> 05:50.720
are replaced by something cheaper, such as transactions of paper money.

05:50.720 --> 05:59.620
When I say "expensive" and "cheaper", I mean the expenses in ledgers at the bank,

05:59.620 --> 06:07.920
the expenses of record keeping, the expenses of clerks to be employed to do these things,

06:08.020 --> 06:15.819
the weighing of the gold and silver, the verification that it contains

06:15.819 --> 06:26.819
an amount which is faithful to that which is portrayed;

06:26.819 --> 06:36.220
is the gold of unknown purity (?), and can that purity be ascertained

06:36.220 --> 06:50.820
when the precious metal has already been mixed with a base metal?

06:50.820 --> 07:01.120
A debtor of a commercial bank is somebody who has borrowed money from the bank,

07:01.120 --> 07:15.519
i.e. hopefully a person who has the means of generating a viable and substantial profit out of which this debt can be repaid.

07:15.519 --> 07:24.019
Profit is generated by enterprise.

07:24.120 --> 07:33.419
A creditor of the commercial bank is somebody who has lent money to the bank.

07:33.419 --> 07:43.319
These creditors are people whom have invested in the bank, i.e. its shareholders.

07:43.319 --> 07:55.620
From their investments, the bank buys its reserves in gold and silver coins, which it keeps in its coffers.

07:55.620 --> 08:07.219
Let us say that this bank has in its reserves 20,000 pounds in gold and silver.

08:07.220 --> 08:23.620
The bank issues notes to the extent of 100,000 pounds: which a particular banker lends among his customers.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.019
I quote,

08:26.019 --> 08:32.220
"As those notes serve all the purposes of money,

08:32.220 --> 08:40.919
his debtors pay him the same interest as if he had lent them so much money.

08:40.919 --> 08:47.320
This interest is the source of his gain."

08:47.320 --> 08:53.220
(end quote).

08:53.220 --> 09:02.519
So, the debtor, who is the entrepreneur who has borrowed these promissory notes,

09:02.519 --> 09:13.220
receives promissory notes which entitle him, or anybody else to whom he pays these promissory notes, to go to the bank

09:13.220 --> 09:29.320
and demand payment in gold or silver coin for the amount which is written on these promissory notes.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.920
I quote,

09:32.920 --> 09:43.120
"Though some of those notes are continually coming back upon him for payment,

09:43.120 --> 09:52.520
part of them continue to circulate for months and years together."

09:52.520 --> 09:58.620
(end quote).

09:58.620 --> 10:04.220
He, in this case, is the banker.

10:04.220 --> 10:12.419
The banker's notes are continually coming back upon the banker for payment;

10:12.419 --> 10:21.720
and part of these notes continue to circulate for months and years together.

10:21.820 --> 10:34.519
Because the demands made upon the bank for the payment of the actual precious metal is only occasional:

10:34.519 --> 10:50.120
say, within any month less than only 1% of the total paper money issued is returned to the bank for payment;

10:50.120 --> 11:00.919
henceforth, the gold and silver coin coming toward the bank from the debtors, whom are honouring the repayments of their loans,

11:00.919 --> 11:06.620
is greater than the amount outgoing.

11:06.620 --> 11:15.919
So the bank is making a profit by getting more gold and silver coin back than it had before.

11:15.919 --> 11:22.819
It is getting back more than it lends.

11:22.819 --> 11:27.719
By issuing promissory notes,

11:27.719 --> 11:37.019
it is issuing a promise to pay the bearer upon demand

11:37.019 --> 11:46.319
the sum of £1: which is the same as writing an I.O.U. (I owe you) for £1;

11:46.319 --> 11:53.819
but the bank ultimately is gaining interest upon each I.O.U. it issues,

11:53.819 --> 12:01.919
which are to be paid back in full with this interest.

12:01.919 --> 12:10.019
This system worked reasonably well, provided the following criteria were met.

12:10.019 --> 12:16.719
1. Not too many of the debtors became bankrupt.

12:16.719 --> 12:23.819
2. The debtors did not fail to meet their repayments.

12:24.020 --> 12:30.320
3. There was not a run on the bank,

12:30.320 --> 12:40.920
whereby it was perceived by the public in general that the bank would not be able to pay out the coin as precious metal.

12:40.919 --> 12:47.719
4. The bank did not issue paper money

12:47.719 --> 13:02.219
worth more than five times it had as gold and silver within its treasuries.

13:02.219 --> 13:07.519
If the bank, being run by scatterbrained management,

13:07.519 --> 13:17.519
would lend to enterprises which would not have in the end generated sufficient profits,

13:17.519 --> 13:22.620
then the banker would be issuing paper money,

13:22.620 --> 13:32.720
which is called the principal debt, the main amount of which would never be repaid, never mind the interest.

13:32.720 --> 13:38.420
When this happened, and Smith explained that it did,

13:38.420 --> 13:54.519
the consequences upon the country, the society, and the nation, were graver than those of a mere run upon the bank.

13:54.519 --> 14:01.019
Recall that the circulating currency, which is money,

14:01.019 --> 14:14.019
always gravitates toward stock which employs people who perform industry using this stock.

14:14.019 --> 14:28.220
This postulate is always the case, no matter how many misconceived economists from the 20th century delude themselves otherwise.

14:28.220 --> 14:39.019
Just say the total stock of England had room for one million gold sovereigns.

14:39.019 --> 14:46.419
That is, the one million gold sovereigns would gravitate toward this type of stock

14:46.419 --> 14:55.819
which produces vendible commodities profitably, and not the other way round.

14:55.819 --> 15:05.319
If each commercial bank never issued a total of more than five times the amount of precious metal it kept within its coffers,

15:05.320 --> 15:14.520
then all would be well and good, because for an amount in their coffers of £200,000,

15:14.520 --> 15:23.520
an amount of £1 million of paper money would become circulated.

15:23.620 --> 15:34.720
This would enable £800,000 within the national circulation and private savings of people

15:34.720 --> 15:49.319
to be sent primarily abroad as foreign investments, or alternatively to import goods from abroad to be consumed domestically.

15:49.320 --> 15:55.620
There was no space for this £800,000 within the domestic circulation,

15:55.620 --> 16:11.720
so the price of gold may have fallen slightly at this time, before gold left the country, it being worth more abroad.

16:11.720 --> 16:19.820
If, and when, any of the commercial banks were lax in predicting critically future prospects,

16:19.820 --> 16:32.720
then there would be more paper money in circulation than stock which was capable of generating a profit.

16:32.720 --> 16:46.620
After the £800,000 of gold had been sent abroad for investment,

16:46.620 --> 16:55.420
the holder of paper money finding no suitable opportunities to invest in stock profitably domestically,

16:55.419 --> 17:06.319
and being unable to send this paper money abroad, would demand payment in precious metal coin at the commercial bank

17:06.319 --> 17:15.220
in order to send the gold in the coin abroad for foreign investments.

17:15.220 --> 17:23.319
Gold would leave the country, resulting in a shortage of gold sovereigns within England.

17:23.319 --> 17:35.919
So, the Bank of England would now have to buy gold, often from abroad, where it cost more because it was not in surplus there.

17:35.919 --> 17:47.220
It was being used as circulating money.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.720
I quote,

17:49.720 --> 18:05.620
"By issuing too great a quantity of paper, of which the excess was continually returning, in order to be exchanged for gold and silver,

18:05.619 --> 18:17.919
the Bank of England was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the extent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a year;

18:17.919 --> 18:27.019
or, at an average, about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds."

18:27.019 --> 18:32.119
(end quote).

18:32.119 --> 18:34.819
I quote,

18:34.919 --> 18:40.619
"The Bank of England, it is to be observed,

18:40.619 --> 18:50.419
by supplying its own coffers with coin, is indirectly obliged to supply the whole kingdom,

18:50.419 --> 19:02.419
into which coin is continually flowing from those coffers in a great variety of ways."

19:02.420 --> 19:09.019
(end quote).

19:09.019 --> 19:20.620
Coin is continually flowing toward the kingdom from the coffers of the bank.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.019
I quote,

19:23.019 --> 19:37.619
"It was the newest, the heaviest, and the best pieces only, which were carefully picked out of the whole coin, and either sent abroad or melted down."

19:37.619 --> 19:42.920
(end quote).

19:42.920 --> 19:46.819
I quote,

19:46.919 --> 19:53.220
"The Bank of England, notwithstanding their great annual coinage,

19:53.220 --> 20:05.220
found, to their astonishment, that there was every year the same scarcity of coin as there had been the year before;

20:05.220 --> 20:16.019
and that, notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new coin which was every year issued from the bank,

20:16.019 --> 20:30.619
the state of the coin, instead of growing better and better, became every year worse and worse.

20:30.619 --> 20:46.219
Every year they found themselves under the necessity of coining nearly the same quantity of gold as they had coined the year before;

20:46.219 --> 20:47.819
and

20:47.819 --> 20:53.819
from the continual rise in the price of gold bullion,

20:53.819 --> 20:59.419
in consequence of the continual wearing and clipping of the coin,

20:59.420 --> 21:08.820
the expence of this great annual coinage became, every year, greater and greater."

21:08.820 --> 21:13.420
(end quote).

21:13.420 --> 21:15.920
I quote,

21:15.920 --> 21:28.620
"Whatever coin, therefore, was wanted to support this excessive circulation both of Scotch and English paper money,

21:28.619 --> 21:39.119
whatever vacuities this excessive circulation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom,

21:39.119 --> 21:44.419
the Bank of England was obliged to supply them.

21:44.419 --> 21:55.319
The Scotch banks, no doubt, paid all of them very dearly for their own imprudence and inattention:

21:55.319 --> 22:01.720
but the Bank of England paid very dearly, not only for its own imprudence,

22:01.720 --> 22:10.119
but for the much greater imprudence of almost all the Scotch banks."

22:10.119 --> 22:12.119
(end quote).
