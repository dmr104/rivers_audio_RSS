00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I now quote directly from chapter 24 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,920
The removal of Saint Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,320
His subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperor's steps

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,440
from Constantinople to Antioch; and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,359
injudicious attempt to relieve their distress.

6
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,600
The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria; and the price of bread,

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,359
in the markets of Antioch, had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn.

8
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:54,120
But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly.

9
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,479
In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his

10
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:06,079
exclusive property, is used by another as a lucrative object of trade, and is required

11
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,560
by a third for the daily and necessary support of life; all the profits of the intermediate

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,000
agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,519
The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and

14
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:33,799
anxiety; and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine.

15
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:41,079
When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian

16
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,879
publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine,

17
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:54,039
oil, and bread; but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for

18
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:59,759
the subsistence of his people.

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,120
With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,319
by legal authority, the value of corn.

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,400
He enacted that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which had seldom

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,359
been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his

23
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:33,280
laws, he sent into the market 422,000 modii, or measures, which were drawn by his order

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,840
from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis and even of Egypt.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,319
The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt.

26
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,840
The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants;

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,599
the proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the

28
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,199
small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal

29
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,000
price.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,799
Julian still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people

31
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,560
as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy,

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,799
though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus.

33
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,719
The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.

34
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:38,840
He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands,

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,280
or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country;

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,159
and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense, not of public

37
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,599
duty, but of private interest.

38
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,719
The whole body, consisting of 200 of the most noble and wealthy citizens, were sent under

39
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:05,439
a guard from the palace to the prison; and, though they were permitted, before the close

40
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,280
of evening, to return to their respective houses, the emperor himself could not obtain

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,639
the forgiveness which he had so easily granted.

42
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,759
The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints, which were industriously

43
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,560
circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks.

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,319
During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent

45
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,399
songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the personal conduct, and even the beard of

46
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,360
the emperor; and the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
and the applause of the multitude.
