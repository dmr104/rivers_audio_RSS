1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,679
Now I shall talk about the word as "cost".

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:20,480
We put apples on the left side of the see-saw, and money on the right-hand side.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,679
Now, the cost of 10 apples was £1.

4
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,800
The cost of apples doubles.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,640
Now, the cost of 10 apples is £2.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,799
Please draw a table, the same as the one you drew before.

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,879
From left to right, the columns are apples and money.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,359
From top to bottom, the rows are apples and money, in that order.

9
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,359
Now, we fill in the north-east cell.

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:17,560
The ratio of one-to-one has been transformed into a ratio of one-to-two, apples to money.

11
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,959
So far, so good.

12
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:39,879
We now investigate whether the cell in the south-west position is identical,

13
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,799
i.e. does it have a ratio of one-to-two after the transformation,

14
00:01:45,799 --> 00:02:00,519
when we invert the position of apples and money on the see-saw?

15
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:15,319
We shall now put money on the left-hand side of the see-saw, and apples on the right.

16
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:25,959
We investigate, using psychological words, linguistic possibilities.

17
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:33,159
The cost of £1 is 10 apples.

18
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,639
This is previous to any change.

19
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:43,240
Now, after the change, the cost of money doubles.

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:52,280
How many apples can £1 now purchase?

21
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:01,360
I must point out that cost is not the cost of borrowing money from any central bank, or subsidiary bank.

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,320
But we're treating the cost of £1 as a commodity in comparison to the cost of say $1 as a commodity.

23
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:18,039
Treat money sterling like the cost of any commodity.

24
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:32,680
An economist might say something like: the interest rate increases, reducing the cost of money;

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,400
and the price of it should go down depending upon a demand curve.

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,240
But we're not talking about anything of the sort.

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:04:00,120
We're saying that where money is, say, a banana, the cost of one banana is 10 apples, previously.

28
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,840
And if the cost of a banana doubles, how many apples can one banana now purchase?

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll give you time to pause to think about this.

30
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:29,480
Well, the 20th century, the 21st century viewpoint, and the explanation of it, is that, previously, £1

31
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,160
would buy 10 apples; so, the cost of each apple was 10 pence.

32
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:43,560
And if the cost of money doubles, subsequently the cost of any apple becomes 20 pence.

33
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:53,720
So, we can only buy five of them after this transformation in cost.

34
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,320
So, what do we have in our south-west cell in our cost table?

35
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:09,400
Well, if £1 can buy 10 apples previously, and only five after,

36
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,440
that's the same as saying that £2 will buy 10 apples after.

37
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:31,720
So, our ratio, from one-to-one money to apples, has become a ratio of two-to-one money to apples.

38
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,159
But this is inconsistent with our north-east cell.

39
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:41,480
Again, we have an inconsistency in the 20th century

40
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:48,040
linguistic understanding: which is purely psychological, which exists entirely in our heads,

41
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,000
and nowhere in external reality.

42
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,240
So, we can already conclude that the 20th century viewpoint about the word "cost" is wrong.

43
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
It is inconsistent: therefore it can't be true.

44
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,280
The ratio is inverted depending on which position we put apples, and which position we put

45
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,239
money, on which side of the see-saw. It is asymmetric.

46
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:23,399
We don't have a symmetrical ratio within the given transformation.

47
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,639
Now, the mystery is to examine which cell is correct:

48
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,799
is it the north-east cell, or is it the south-west cell?

49
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:36,119
To do this, we will need to examine the 18th century viewpoint,

50
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,360
and hopefully it will be consistent. If it is consistent, we know it to be true;

51
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,360
and this will reveal which one of our cells is the external reality.

52
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,519
Please note that in the table for the 18th century price,

53
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:04,920
both the south-west cell, and the north-east cell, have become transformed to

54
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,600
the same ratio, which is one-to-two:

55
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:20,840
that is one-to-two of the left-hand side to the right-hand side.

56
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,240
It didn't matter whether we place apples, or money, on the left-hand side: we got the same result.

57
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,120
The semantic meaning of the word "money" didn't change that in the 18th century.

58
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:47,160
We note that it did in the 20th century, previously.

59
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,880
I posit that

60
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:03,640
the correct cell for the cost in the 20th century is the north-east cell.

61
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,840
It's merely a speculation at this stage; and the reason I say that is because

62
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:18,599
we have a seemingly non-absurd transformed ratio

63
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,719
of one-to-two, apples to money, left-hand side to the right-hand side.

64
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:36,039
I believe that words, and concepts, should have clearly definable

65
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,559
meanings, as, indeed, should prepositions within sentences.

66
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:47,240
I note that the prepositions within the English language have become very chaotic,

67
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,519
and this transitional change within linguistics has occurred beginning of

68
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,439
Victorian times, right through the 20th century, up until the present day.

69
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:07,800
To examine the concept of money further,

70
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,920
let us consider what money could have been thought of during most of the Iron Age,

71
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,480
which was maybe a pound of iron ore, smelted from some mine.

72
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:29,639
So, I'd like to examine the north-east cell first.

73
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,840
The transformed ratio of the cost of apples, to the cost of money:

74
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,600
which I've speculated, as a hypothesis, that it should be

75
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,440
one-to-two, apples to money,

76
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,360
exchangeable amount of; which is after the transformation.

77
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,400
This makes linguistic sense as a concept, both in the 20th century, and indeed in the 18th century,

78
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,960
because the cost of something is the amount on the right-hand side of the see-saw,

79
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,600
when we put the something on the left-hand side.

80
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:32,680
That is, if 10 apples on the left-hand side would cost one pound of iron ore on the right-hand side;

81
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:45,000
then, if the cost of apples doubles, then we now require two pounds of iron ore to exchange

82
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:52,199
by 10 apples. To put it another way,

83
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,079
10 apples to exchange by two pounds of iron ore.

84
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,559
Recall that we are treating iron as money: pounds of iron as money.

85
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:20,359
Now invert these positions: put money, which is iron, on the left-hand side of the see-saw,

86
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,199
and put apples on the right-hand side of the see-saw.

87
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:39,800
So, we are saying that one pound of iron exchanges by 10 apples; and subsequent to a transformation,

88
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,000
the cost of iron doubles.

89
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:57,000
So, we can infer linguistically that whatever is on the right-hand side of the see-saw, which is apples,

90
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,639
is now going to be required in double the amount to exchange

91
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,679
for what is on the left-hand side of the see-saw: which is one pound of iron.

92
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:16,519
So when the pound of iron, cost of, doubles, we now exchange by 20 apples.

93
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,279
This is the 18th century viewpoint, and it is logically consistent.

94
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,879
It is semantically consistent, and it is syntactically consistent.

95
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,319
Money doesn't do anything special semantically to the syntax of the see-saw.

96
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:44,920
It is symmetrical. So, the 18th century is correct; and my erstwhile hypothesis, which was that

97
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,280
what is on the right-hand side of the see-saw doubles in amount, by the word "cost", when the

98
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,360
cost doubles, of the substance on the left-hand side, seems sound.

99
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,040
Recall I previously mentioned that the word "price"

100
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
doubles the amount on the right-hand side.

101
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,480
Now, we can infer that the word "cost" doubles the amount that's on the right-hand side.

102
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,120
We're forming a pretty picture, so far.

103
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,640
But what is concerning is that the word "cost" in the 20th century is inconsistent.

104
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,319
So, when we use the words "cost of money", or, indeed, the more modern syntax,

105
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,639
which is the words as "cost to money",

106
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:50,360
we are not hitting reality in the correct place:

107
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:59,319
we're deluding ourselves, because when money is treated as a commodity, we fail.

108
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:17,319
Money is no different to any other commodity, as an external reality, I say, anyway.

109
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,319
Here ends my discussion of the word as "cost".
