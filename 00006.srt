1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Introduction part two, the psychology of money.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,400
I shall adumbrate that when the price of money is considered in the modern world, the psychology

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,960
of this evaluation leads to an inverted understanding where the hidden reality will exist behind

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,240
our backs and be quite opposite to that which we think we understand.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,120
I am going to use three concepts: price, cost and worth.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,000
I shall first follow an understanding of the 20th century viewpoint of the word "price",

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,760
that of "cost" and that of "worth".

8
00:00:52,759 --> 00:01:02,439
I shall show how any of these concepts differed in Adam Smith's day from the present moment.

9
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,120
I shall define a few things here now.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:15,759
If I have ten apples, then the price of ten apples in apples is, well, ten apples.

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,239
The cost of ten apples is ten apples, and the worth of ten apples is ten apples.

12
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:30,719
Likewise, if I have £100 in money, the price of this money is £100, the cost of this money

13
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:41,280
is £100, and the worth of this money is £100. No problem so far.

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:57,319
Here, I have implicitly defined the cost of apples in apples, and the worth of apples in apples.

15
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:09,680
Now, imagine a see-saw, or in America a teeter-totter. At the centre pivot is a label, and that label

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:20,360
says "price". On the left-hand side, as we view the see-saw, is ten apples.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,120
On the right-hand side of the see-saw is £1, in money.

18
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:39,000
So, we can say that the price of ten apples was £1: "was" because it shall change in a moment.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:53,879
Now, the price of apples doubles. So, now ten apples cost £2.

20
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,920
Previously, ten apples were worth £1.

21
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,800
Now, after the transformation, ten apples are worth £2.

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,960
What was a ratio of apples to money of one-to-one has now become a ratio of apples to

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,320
money of one to two.

24
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,800
What was a one to one ratio, if ten apples can be considered as one unit, and one pound

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,800
can be considered as one unit, has now become a one-to-two ratio.

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,439
Draw a table please.

27
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:43,439
We have on the columns, apples then money, going from left to right. And in the rows, we have

28
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,640
apples and money, going top to bottom.

29
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,360
This is a table of price.

30
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Now, we've evaluated the ratio of apples to money as one-to-two: which is after the transformation.

31
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Please write in the north-east cell of the table, the transformed ratio as one-to-two.

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:30,560
Now, let us consider what happens if we put money on the left side of the see-saw, and apples

33
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,840
on the right side of the see-saw. The central pivot still has a label that says price.

34
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,560
So, we are basically inverting what we are doubling.

35
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,480
So, previously we doubled the price of apples; now we double the price of money.

36
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,480
But, wait a minute, you might be saying: the price of money doesn't make any sense, because

37
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,840
the price of money has to be evaluated in money. But I said the Universe will exist

38
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,360
behind our backs.

39
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,960
I say the exchangeable price is however much it will swap for, of any commodity: in this

40
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,840
case it's apples.

41
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,120
But the 20th century psychological viewpoint does not concur with this, my viewpoint, when

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,000
we consider the price of money.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,120
Our erstwhile condition, which is our previous set of circumstances, is that the one pound

44
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,959
will exchange for ten apples. So, the exchangeable amount of money is one pound, and this will

45
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:48,160
swap by ten apples on the market previously.

46
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,080
By the 20th-century viewpoint, when the price of money doubles, this infers that the amount

47
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,600
of money required doubles.

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Money doubles.

49
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:11,200
So, now, two pounds will exchange for ten apples. This is the same as saying that one pound

50
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,159
of money will exchange for five apples.

51
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:24,519
This is because the ten apples will now cost two pounds.

52
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:32,159
So, if I have one pound, which will exchange for ten apples, and the price of this one pound

53
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:43,120
doubles, then one pound will exchange for five apples, because two pounds will exchange

54
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,960
for ten.

55
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,920
It is the exchangeable price of this pound which has risen.

56
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,040
More of it will be required: more pounds will be required to exchange for the commodity,

57
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,240
which is apples, than before.

58
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:14,199
So, one pound has just transformed to two pounds, where the units of apples remains the same.

59
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,120
I really must stress again that this is the 20th century viewpoint about what happens

60
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,000
by a change in the price of money.

61
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,079
It does not concur with the 18th-century viewpoint.

62
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:46,720
So in the south-west cell of our price table, we have a ratio of two-to-one: that is two

63
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,680
units of money to one units of apple.

64
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,720
Recall that in the north-east cell of the table, we had one unit of apple to two units

65
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
of money.

66
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:18,600
So far, our table is syntactically inconsistent. But it doesn't matter what we pay in, we get

67
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,720
the same result.

68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,360
We are dealing with exchangeable amounts.

69
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:43,000
If I have a Rolex watch, the price of which I am selling for twenty thousand pounds. And

70
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,519
if I have four hundred Casio watches, the price of which each is fifty pounds.

71
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:02,960
And if I now abandon money altogether, and use a direct bartering scheme, I may swap four

72
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:16,319
hundred of my Casio watches for one of your Rolex watches.

73
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Now, if the price of my Rolex watch increases, then fewer Rolex watches will swap by four

74
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,440
hundred Casio watches: which is the same thing as saying that more Casio watches will swap

75
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:48,080
by one Rolex watch.

76
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Returning to the evaluation in terms of money, if your Rolex watch has transformed in price

77
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,000
from twenty thousand pounds to thirty thousand pounds, then, after this transformation, it will

78
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,320
swap by six hundred of my fifty pound Casio watches.

79
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,600
Now, let us call your Rolex ten apples.

80
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,919
What is in a name?

81
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,779
Would not a rose by any other name still smell as sweet?

82
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,759
It doesn't matter what we call the variable.

83
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:43,439
Ten apples is one unit -- is the name for one Rolex as one unit.

84
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:57,399
And let my four hundred Casio's be called "one pound" as a unit. Thus, if the price of

85
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:11,639
your ten apples doubles, it will now exchange by two pounds of money.

86
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:23,279
The ratio as the amounts has transformed from a ratio of one-to-one into a ratio of one

87
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:36,039
-to-two, where the apples were placed on the left-hand side of the see-saw.

88
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,639
No problem so far.

89
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:55,960
Now, let your Rolex be called one pound in money. And let my four hundred Casios be

90
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:02,240
called "ten apples".

91
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:16,480
When your Rolex doubles in price, it requires more Casios to exchange by it:

92
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,360
it requires eight hundred Casios.

93
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:31,840
But wait a minute. Your Rolex was called "one pound". So, surely, if one pound would double

94
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:44,840
in price, then it would require twenty apples to be exchanged for it by the eighteenth-century

95
00:12:44,840 --> 00:13:01,000
viewpoint; not five apples to be exchanged for it by the twentieth-century viewpoint.

96
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,240
This viewpoint is non-intuitive to the modern interpretation.

97
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,039
What I am saying is that by the eighteenth-century viewpoint, the price of a commodity

98
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:29,159
is the amount of something else which will exchange by this commodity.

99
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:40,519
The mistake we made was to say that when the price of money doubles, the amount of money

100
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:50,839
becomes transformed into itself doubling.

101
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,519
By the eighteenth-century viewpoint, when the price of money doubles, the amount of

102
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:13,680
money becomes transformed by itself halving.

103
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:21,939
Because the twentieth-century -- or is it the twenty-first century (?) -- point of view, is inconsistent,

104
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:28,879
We know it's incorrect.

105
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:37,059
Depending on where we place money -- is it on the left-hand side of the see-saw, or is apples

106
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:43,979
on the left-hand side of the see-saw (?) -- we get a different result.

107
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:51,139
We know that Adam Smith was correct because he's logically consistent.

108
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:58,899
The same format as the price table by the eighteenth-century viewpoint has the transformed

109
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:07,419
ratio of one-to-two in the north-east cell, and the transformed ratio of one-to-two in

110
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:13,419
the south-west cell.

111
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:21,620
The semantic meaning of the word as money does not alter the syntax of this table.

112
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,100
It does not alter the syntactical meaning.

113
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:33,340
The table is syntactically consistent in the eighteenth century.

114
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,379
This ends my discussion about the word as price.
