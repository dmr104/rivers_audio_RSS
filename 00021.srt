00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
We have examined the case where the exchange between Scotland and France was on par:

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,399
that is, 17% of the Scotch whisky production was exchangeable by the same amount of stuff

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,039
that 41% of the French wine production would exchange by.

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,679
This stuff could have been building materials, could have been cars, could have been houses even.

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:37,280
Let us say the stuff was sovereigns, golden sovereigns, and 17% of the Scotch whisky production

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
was equal to 10,000 gold sovereigns:

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,920
that is, 41% of the French wine production was also equal to 10,000 gold sovereigns.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:03,920
But, you might be asking, what if the exchange of actual commodities would be uneven, i.e. the balance of trade would be uneven?

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Let us examine this scenario.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Let us say that the French market for Scotch whisky expands:

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,920
that is, the absolute demand of French people becomes a wish to purchase more whisky than before.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Let us augment this demand by 5,000 gold sovereigns; i.e., the amount of whisky which Scotland exports to France,

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,920
which was previously 17%, now becomes 23.5%.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:48,920
We are saying that an extra worth of 5,000 sovereigns above the worth of whisky as 10,000 sovereigns already exported

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:59,920
becomes produced as a consequence of the increase within the absolute demand of French society for whisky exported from Scotland.

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:13,920
So, where previously, say, 100,000 gallons were produced each year, now 108,500 gallons are produced within the next year

17
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:21,919
due to an increased demand (an increased effectual demand), of the French society for that whisky.

18
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:33,919
Erstwhile (which means previously), 17,000 gallons would exchange by 10,000 sovereigns;

19
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:44,919
now 25,500 gallons, which are exported, will exchange by 15,000 sovereigns.

20
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,919
The demand, however, within Scotland for French wine exported from France, we are saying does not change:

21
00:02:52,919 --> 00:03:02,919
the society within Scotland still only wishes to import 41% of the French wine which is produced within France within both years.

22
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,919
So, the balance of exchange in the second year favours Scotland by 5,000 gold sovereigns

23
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,919
because, in the second year, 15,000 gold sovereigns arrive in Scotland from France,

24
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,919
and 10,000 gold sovereigns arrive within France from Scotland.

25
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,919
The difference, of course, is 5,000 sovereigns arriving in Scotland.

26
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,919
Note, however, it is a fallacy to say that the revenue of Scotland consists in these gold sovereigns.

27
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:45,919
The revenue consists in the worth of, in the first year, 17% of the Scotch whisky production,

28
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,919
and within the second year, 23.5% of the Scotch whisky production.

29
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,919
It is the worth of these gallons of whisky which constitutes the revenue:

30
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,919
and thus it is the exchangeable worth of the gold sovereigns -- that which can be had in exchange for them --

31
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:12,919
not the actual amount of gold sovereigns which is the revenue as 17% of the Scotch whisky production within the first year,

32
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,919
and 23.5% of the production of Scotch whisky within the second year.

33
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Recall that revenue consists in material actual tangible stuff.

34
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Now, it might be thought that in the second year, 5,000 gold sovereigns are leaving France and entering Scotland:

35
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
and indeed, this is the case;

36
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,920
but -- and a very conditional and very important, but -- it is only the case temporarily.

37
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,920
This is because, after the second year, there are fewer gold sovereigns within France than previously.

38
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,920
So, their price rises: that is, the price of gold sovereigns within France rises.

39
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Think: if there are a shortage of apples within France, the price of apples rises.

40
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Thus, the price of gold sovereigns is no different as a commodity.

41
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Misguided people might think that the 5,000 sovereigns discrepancy between the amount entering Scotland from France

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,920
and the amount entering France from Scotland is profit to Scotland.

43
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,920
But, this is not at all the case.

44
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Within the second year, this extra 5,000 gold sovereigns received by Scotland is part of the revenue received,

45
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,920
returning to production and transportation of commodities across the frontier.

46
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:56,920
This revenue (the exchangeable worth of these extra 5,000 gold sovereigns within Scotland),

47
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:05,920
comprises those parts of the revenue which replenish provisions and materials used in producing the Scotch whisky.

48
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:17,920
And also, the part as profit of the revenue (which is of the extra 5,000 gold sovereigns received in Scotland within the second year),

49
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:26,920
may comprehend the whole part which constitutes the stock reserved for immediate consumption, or the wealth of Scotland;

50
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,920
i.e. the extra 5,000 gold sovereigns which are received within Scotland within the second year

51
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:46,920
form an exchangeable worth as part of 15,000 gold sovereigns for the 23.5% of the augmented Scotch whisky production,

52
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,920
which is exported to France.

53
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:59,920
And, this extra revenue as 5,000 gold sovereigns, which buys 8,500 gallons of Scotch whisky production,

54
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,920
consists of those parts of this revenue which, in addition to profit, replenish the provisions and materials

55
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,920
used in producing the finished goods as barrels of whisky.

56
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:24,920
So, part of the exchangeable worth of these extra 5,000 gold sovereigns received within Scotland may be profit:

57
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
that is, not all of these 5,000 gold sovereigns are profit.

58
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,920
But what happens to this part as profit made within Scotland?

59
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
The answer is that it is either consumed, saved, or invested.

60
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,920
The owner of this profit might wish to buy a yacht, in which case it is consumed,

61
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,920
or she might save it in the form of bullion or gold plate,

62
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
or she might invest it.

63
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
And, here lies the rub.

64
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Due to the 5,000 gold sovereign having left France for Scotland,

65
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,920
the price of gold within France may become greater than that within Scotland.

66
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
So the worth of this gold within France might become greater than within Scotland.

67
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:27,920
It makes more sense therefore for the owner of the profit within Scotland to invest within an enterprise within France,

68
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
because by doing so, she will get more bang for her buck.

69
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,920
She will be able to acquire more capital than by investing within Scotland.

70
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,920
There is a negative feedback mechanism here.

71
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,920
It is more lucrative and attractive due to the balance of exchange being against France for investments to be made within France.

72
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,919
As these investments subsequently become made, the gold returns to France again.

73
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,919
In addition to this mechanism, there is also another mechanism by which the gold leaving France will return to France,

74
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,919
and this additional mechanism is as follows.

75
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:21,919
We know by the unequal balance of trade that the price of gold within France rises in comparison to the price of gold within Scotland.

76
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:32,919
Assume that within France the worth of 600 bushels of corn is the same as the worth of 600 bushels of corn within Scotland.

77
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:42,919
So, within France, 600 bushels of corn will exchange for less gold than it will within Scotland.

78
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,919
The gold is more scarce within France:

79
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,919
its worth is higher within France, i.e. its price is higher.

80
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:10,919
This is equivalent to saying, so many sovereigns will buy me more corn, more wheat, more produce, more commodities within France than it will do so within Scotland.

81
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:21,919
So, it would be more lucrative for the merchant to buy productions within France than it would to buy such within Scotland.

82
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,919
Henceforth, material tangible produce leaves France to arrive in Scotland.

83
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,919
Thus more gold now transitions from Scotland to France.

84
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,919
This is the reverse direction than what caused the initial increase in the price of gold within France:

85
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:57,919
which was that more gold left France to Scotland than arrived in France from Scotland due to an imbalance within the balance of trade between exportation of whisky from Scotland to France and exportation of wine from France to Scotland.

86
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:14,919
We observe that this mechanism is also a negative feedback mechanism which regulates it such that the money which leaves France is returning back to France: i.e., the gold sovereigns which leave France return back to France.

87
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:23,919
Of course, French money was in livre, and sous, or ducats, or something, at the time, but the principle is the same.

88
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,919
It doesn't matter whether we're talking about the gold contained within, or the price of euros and the price of British pounds.

89
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Within Book 4, Chapter 3, Part 2, Adam Smith wrote,

90
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:48,919
Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss.

91
00:11:49,919 --> 00:12:01,919
Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity. (End quote)

92
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:17,919
(I quote) The whole capital of England would no more be diminished by this exportation of gold and silver, than by the exportation of an equal value of any other goods.

93
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,919
On the contrary, it would in most cases be augmented. (End quote)

94
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:33,919
Thus, the capital of Scotland, in our example, would be augmented by unfettered trade with France;

95
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,919
and that of France would be augmented by unfettered trade with England.

96
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:54,919
It is an observation of mine that a monoculture of palm trees does not have the same ecological diversity as the ecological "free market" of a rainforest.

97
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,919
So to infer that the palm tree plantation is unfettered and unchained is a cognitive dissonance.

98
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:15,919
I believe in social safety nets such as a welfare state and public services such as sewage systems, prisons, schools, hospitals, police, teachers;

99
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,919
but the revenue to pay for these must be acquired via a method of taxation which is not inflationary.

100
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,919
I say this can be done.

101
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,919
Adam Smith said,

102
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:51,919
If the tobacco which in England is worth only £100,000 when sent to France will purchase wine which is in England worth £110,000, the exchange will augment the capital of England by £10,000.

103
00:13:52,919 --> 00:14:11,919
If £100,000 of English gold, in the same manner, purchase French wine which in England is worth £110,000, this exchange will equally augment the capital of England by £10,000.

104
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:27,919
As a merchant, who has £110,000 worth of wine in his cellar, is a richer man than he who has only £100,000 worth of tobacco in his warehouse,

105
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:37,919
so is he likewise a richer man than he who has only £100,000 worth of gold in his coffers. (End quote.)

106
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,919
I paraphrase,

107
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:52,919
He, the merchant with £110,000 worth of wine in his cellar, which he has purchased by exchanging it for £100,000 of gold,

108
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:18,919
can put into motion a greater quantity of industry, and give revenue, maintenance, and employment, to a greater number of people than either of the other two -- where the other two are: the merchant with 100,000 worth of tobacco in his warehouse, and the merchant with £100,000 of gold within his coffers.

109
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,919
(End paraphrase.)

110
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,919
I quote,

111
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:38,919
But the capital of the country is equal to the capital of all its different inhabitants; and the quantity of industry which can be annually maintained in it is equal to what all those different capitals can maintain.

112
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:49,919
Both the capital of the country, therefore, and the quantity of industry which can be annually maintained in it, must generally be augmented by this exchange.

113
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,919
End quote.

114
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,919
And what did Adam Smith say pertaining to when the balance of trade would be against England and in favour of France?

115
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,919
I quote,

116
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:18,919
The trade, however, would in this case, as in the foregoing, give some revenue to the inhabitants of both countries, but more to those of France than to those of England.

117
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,919
It would give some revenue to those of England.

118
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,919
The capital which had been employed in producing the English goods that purchased this gold and silver,

119
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:41,919
the capital which had been distributed among, and given revenue to certain inhabitants of England, would thereby be replaced, and enabled to continue that employment.

120
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,919
End quote.

121
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,919
I quote,

122
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:58,919
In every country it always is, and must be, the interest of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest.

123
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,920
This proposition is so very manifest, that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it;

124
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:15,920
nor could it ever have been called into question, had not the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common sense of mankind.

125
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Their interest is, in this respect, directly opposite to that of the great body of the people.

126
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
End quote.

127
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I quote,

128
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Hence, in Great Britain, and most other European countries, the extraordinary duties upon almost all goods imported by alien merchants.

129
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Hence the high duties and prohibitions upon all those foreign manufacturers which can come into competition with our own.

130
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
End quote.

131
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
I quote,

132
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:05,920
The violence and injustice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil, for which, I am afraid, the nature of human affairs can scarce admit of a remedy:

133
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:25,920
but the mean rapacity, the monopolising spirit of merchants and manufacturers who neither are nor to be the rulers of mankind, though it cannot perhaps be corrected, may very easily be prevented from disturbing the tranquility of anybody but themselves.

134
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
End quote.
