1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,660
Previously, I described an Agio as being the difference between the market price of bullion

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,460
and the market price of bank money.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:30,980
Smith, however, refers to an Agio as any difference between, say, the market price of clipped,

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:40,260
worn coin and the market price of fresh, newly minted coin, from which that old, worn, clipped

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,020
coin was melted down into.

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:55,100
Note that the old, worn, clipped coin may have consisted of currency flooding into the country

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,980
from neighbouring states, and other nations far and wide.

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:16,420
I quote from Book 4, Chapter 3, Part 1, "Digression Concerning Banks of Deposit, particularly

9
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:27,539
concerning that of Amsterdam": The money of such banks, being better than the common currency

10
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,420
of the country, necessarily bore an agio, which was greater or smaller, according as the currency

11
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:47,780
was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the state.

12
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:56,940
The agio of the Bank of Hamburg, for example, which is said to be commonly about 14%, is

13
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:04,899
the supposed difference between the good standard money of the state, and the clipt,

14
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:14,860
worn, and diminished currency poured into it from all the neighbouring states.

15
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:31,620
(End quote). So I define an agio to be any difference between the market price of manifestations

16
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:43,780
of money, be that the difference between clipped, worn, debased currency, and freshly minted currency,

17
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:52,460
or, indeed, the difference between freshly-minted currency and the bank money which was awarded

18
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:59,900
in the books of the Bank of Amsterdam.

19
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,379
Likewise, we could also describe the difference between clipped, worn, debased coin and the market

20
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:21,900
price of bullion as an agio. So, an agio is defined as the difference itself pertaining

21
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:40,340
to prices of manifestations of money, not a specific difference between particular endpoints.

22
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:48,379
Now, I have scarcely used the word as "value" within this discussion so far.

23
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:55,019
There is a reason I have avoided this, and that is because the definition of the word

24
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:07,579
as "value" can have multiple definitions, and can mean different things to different people.

25
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:16,180
In the final chapter, chapter 71 part 3 of Edwin Gibbon's History of the Decline and

26
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:25,699
Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbons states: The value of any object that supplies the

27
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:35,379
wants or pleasures of mankind is compounded of its substance and its form, of the materials

28
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:51,420
and the manufacture. (End quote). I agree with Gibbon. For example, the value of a piece of industrial

29
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:59,060
machinery, such as a combine-harvester is what John Maynard Keynes, during the first half

30
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:15,660
of the 20th century, called its "utility", and perhaps Karl Marx may have called it its "worth".

31
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:24,420
But, this item of modern technology and industrialization was not on the market to be purchased in the

32
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:38,500
year 1776. So the value of Â£50,000 could not buy you a tractor, or a combine-harvester, in

33
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:48,580
the year 1776. Before the invention of tractors, the price

34
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:57,259
of gold used to be measured in however many bushels of corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley,

35
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:08,060
that it could be exchanged for on the market, at the market rate of exchange. But, after

36
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:17,939
the propinquity of tractors within agriculture, the price of corn became much reduced.

37
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:26,259
Latterly, much more corn could be swapped for the same amount of gold: assuming the price

38
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:39,180
of gold to have been a constant throughout this time period. Although Smith is not 100%

39
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:48,300
clear on this point, I define the value of an item to be the orchestration of the total

40
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:57,780
amount of labour, by hand, or by machine, which is performed both to acquire the materials

41
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:06,620
and tools for this object (and the labour performed upon it), and also the labour involved in trade

42
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:13,259
and transportation in order to deliver this object to the precise location where the consumer

43
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:28,259
can acquire it as his property. I think my definition is a pretty good one. In the following

44
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:39,500
quotation from Gibbon, as a continuation of what he previously said, Gibbon refers to

45
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:48,660
"its price", where "its price" is the price of any object. I quote: Its price must depend

46
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,620
on the number of persons by whom it may be acquired and used; on the extent of the market;

47
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:05,420
and consequently on the ease or difficulty of remote exportation, according to the nature

48
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:18,340
of the commodity, its local situation, and the temporary circumstances of the world. (End quote)

49
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,620
I agree again; and I also believe that this concise definition concurs with Smith's lengthier

50
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:32,379
explanation about the same, which I may quote within the main body of this work (book 2: Extinction Avoidance).

51
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:46,539
I was in the process of describing how the price of worn, clipped coin in the state of

52
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:56,580
Hamburg may have borne an agio of 11 percent between that and the price of freshly-minted

53
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:08,300
coin. Likewise, we can also describe an agio as, say, a 5% difference between the bank price

54
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:19,340
of money, awarded by the Bank of Amsterdam, and the mint price of bullion. Let the bank

55
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:30,340
price of money be 5% below the mint price of bullion, and let the market price of bullion

56
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:46,300
be 2% lower than the mint price of bullion. Thus, within these circumstances where the

57
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:57,500
mint price of bullion was 11.5% higher than the price of the clipped, worn, coin, the agio

58
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:05,659
between the clipped, worn, coin and the market price of bullion will be 9.5%.

59
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:20,219
Smith points out that for silver deposited in the form of Mexico dollars, where the fineness

60
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:32,699
is known and ascertained, the bank will award a bank price as 22 guilders the mark: where a mark

61
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:47,820
is a unit in weight. Juxtapose with this: the price of the newly-minted bullion, which was

62
00:10:47,820 --> 00:11:01,580
minted from those Mexico dollars, was 23 guilders per mark in weight. Thus, the bank price of money

63
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:11,100
being lower than the market price of bullion, the bank would award a greater amount of guilders

64
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:23,259
within bank credit than the bullion received as a deposit. It would appear that in the case of the

65
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:32,220
Mexico dollar, the coin as a Mexico dollar was a form of bullion in itself of a very highly

66
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:40,059
desirable worth, because its price was actually 2% or 3% higher than the mint price of bullion.

67
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:47,819
I conclude that the Mexico dollar was a form of international currency which was more highly

68
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,980
desirable in trade than the minted bullion from the city of Amsterdam.
