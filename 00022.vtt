00:00.000 --> 00:20.960
I would like to end this introductory book, one of a quadrilogy, with the thoughts that

00:20.960 --> 00:32.880
when Julius Caesar took his troops across the river Rubicon, he paused: he paused because he knew he

00:32.880 --> 00:42.320
would change the face of civilization and that the path of history would never be the same after

00:42.320 --> 00:59.280
his actions. At the end of chapter 26 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon wrote,

00:59.280 --> 01:09.040
"Such were the scenes of barbaric rage, which disgraced the palace and table of the Roman

01:09.040 --> 01:20.319
Emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of

01:20.639 --> 01:32.639
Theodosius, the public safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single man."

01:36.479 --> 01:37.119
(end quote).

01:37.840 --> 01:59.360
At this moment in time, half of the American voters believe that the economic institutions

01:59.840 --> 02:09.520
which rule them don't function wisely. I concur with this viewpoint.

02:13.280 --> 02:21.439
It is my policy not to be partisan with politics because I wish to persuade politicians.

02:21.919 --> 02:36.800
One thing I am certain though is that the leader who represents these partisan people

02:38.159 --> 02:47.120
possibly won't comprehend a word I have said. For a start he won't have time.

02:51.680 --> 03:06.400
It seems that there will be an ideological battle to win hearts and minds within the world,

03:08.159 --> 03:15.520
particularly surrounding issues regarding land utilisation or land ownership.

03:16.240 --> 03:31.760
This is a subject I deal with within my first book beyond this introductory book called Extinction

03:31.760 --> 03:45.120
Avoidance. On a personal note, I would like to add that I will not be having a career in politics.

03:46.320 --> 03:54.719
I would experience ad hominem attacks which would be counterproductive to the

03:54.719 --> 04:03.520
aims and objectives of my message. You will have to do this one without me.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.320
I shall not be your saviour.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.280
I am not coming to rescue you.

04:26.079 --> 04:27.840
I believe in legal frameworks.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.199
I believe in impartial institutions.

04:33.199 --> 04:45.360
In chapter 58 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon wrote,

04:48.719 --> 04:55.839
"Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of feudal tyranny,

04:55.839 --> 05:08.000
the institution of cities and corporations is one of the most powerful;

05:11.359 --> 05:20.079
and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first crusade,

05:20.800 --> 05:30.240
they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world."

05:30.240 --> 05:54.400
When Gibbon here uses the word as "corporations", he is referring to the legal system, courts, judgments.

05:55.279 --> 06:04.879
Previously, where Adam Smith used the word as "corporations", he was talking about

06:06.719 --> 06:13.839
trade guilds which sought to achieve powers of monopoly within trade.

06:14.159 --> 06:29.439
To be sure, I say the first crusade was a brutal genocidal act of barbaric warfare.

06:29.759 --> 06:43.600
Gibbon is producing evidence about the establishment of bodies which govern,

06:45.199 --> 06:49.839
and saying that those of the region which Jerusalem was part of,

06:50.479 --> 07:02.479
after the first crusade, may be ranked with those of the Byzantine Empire,

07:04.159 --> 07:11.599
the Roman Catholic Church, and what legal and judicial bodies were remaining

07:11.600 --> 07:17.920
during and after the decline of the institutions of Western Rome.

07:26.400 --> 07:39.120
Within the year 1942, the Beverage report addressed want, disease, ignorance, idleness,

07:40.079 --> 07:45.120
and squalor, as five dragons to be slain.

07:48.879 --> 07:51.759
Well, the year is now 2024.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.680
The five dragons I would like to propose

08:01.680 --> 08:16.879
are: sickness, want, idleness, ill health, and vulnerability.

08:17.439 --> 08:29.680
Sickness can be addressed by having a health service which is paid

08:32.879 --> 08:38.639
by taxation in the form of PET.

08:38.799 --> 08:47.439
Want can be addressed by

08:50.639 --> 08:57.439
achieving unfettered and unregulated trade,

09:01.919 --> 09:05.759
not by calling regulation freedom.

09:09.360 --> 09:19.199
Idleness can be addressed by stock employing people

09:21.120 --> 09:30.080
when industry, industrious work, is performed intelligently upon this stock.

09:30.879 --> 09:41.360
Ill health is somewhat of an umbrella term.

09:44.400 --> 09:53.360
In my opinion, people can be linguistically unhealthy if the speaker and the listener

09:53.680 --> 09:59.519
can't achieve a level of communication.

10:08.720 --> 10:15.680
There are many thoughts, particularly thoughts within economics, which lead to

10:17.039 --> 10:20.639
delusive opinions promulgating across the world.

10:20.639 --> 10:31.840
I consider these ideas to be unhealthy because when they are implemented in law

10:33.600 --> 10:36.559
they achieve a sort of prison.

10:39.039 --> 10:47.519
People are waiting for the end of the day without doing anything other than going around in circles.

10:51.039 --> 11:01.279
Now the fifth giant to be slain is vulnerability.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.279
When I say this, I mean vulnerability to autocratic dictators

11:13.519 --> 11:19.919
who often have a position of military strength which is greater than that of Western democracies.

11:21.120 --> 11:35.120
If Western democracies are to not be vulnerable to invasion then

11:37.600 --> 11:47.600
they need industrial output, armaments, shipping industries, steel industries;

11:51.360 --> 11:54.159
they need to do more than retail;

11:58.399 --> 12:01.600
they need to do more than provide banking services;

12:06.559 --> 12:10.000
they need to do more than provide hotels by the seaside.

12:10.720 --> 12:27.279
I believe it can be achievable but not without addressing concepts such as land utilisation

12:27.279 --> 12:39.439
or land ownership because land can't be moved: land is the surface of a sphere.

12:44.799 --> 12:51.360
There's only so much of it that can go around and then its price increases indefinitely

12:52.480 --> 12:55.839
as population and demand for it rises.

12:58.240 --> 13:04.720
Addressing these concepts is an ecological challenge.

13:07.120 --> 13:15.759
The intransigence towards these discussions is the immediate knee-jerk reaction whereby people

13:15.759 --> 13:22.240
say, "Oh, that can't be done because big business has too much invested in land ownership."

13:23.200 --> 13:27.440
But the Romans had so much invested within slavery.

13:30.560 --> 13:39.120
I say that a figure called Jesus was pretty influential in saying revolutionary things

13:39.120 --> 13:42.240
at the time, such as be nice to people.

13:42.240 --> 13:55.600
That Jesus of Nazareth omitted to mention slavery altogether was possibly a masterpiece

13:55.600 --> 14:01.840
of design, a masterpiece of public relations,

14:01.920 --> 14:17.759
because Jesus of Nazareth denormalised this behaviour for future generations.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.759
The Quran, in my opinion, was not so far sighted.

14:25.759 --> 14:35.840
It dealt with local politics such as who was allowed to pass through Medina, and what to do

14:35.840 --> 14:36.960
if you got attacked.

14:42.960 --> 14:49.200
It dealt with women's rights in response to an experience Mohammed had, a revelation,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.120
after having a discussion about the rights of women, with women.

15:00.320 --> 15:07.920
One of the key messages I got from the Quran is that a prophet is not a deity.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.879
A prophet is not the Almighty.

15:13.279 --> 15:22.399
A prophet is a kind of inspired teacher who sees further than somebody else.

15:23.600 --> 15:34.399
I believe that the message of the Quran is not to copy Mohammed;

15:36.399 --> 15:38.399
it is not to dress like him;

15:38.959 --> 15:40.399
it is not to emulate him:

15:46.079 --> 15:56.159
but to understand the inspired messages that are written within the canon of the Islamic faith,

15:57.039 --> 16:06.559
which one of was: isn't it amazing how everything got to be here?

16:06.559 --> 16:13.279
Look at the stars; look at the sky; look at the earth.

16:13.600 --> 16:31.360
And also another central message I received from this religious text was that it is my purpose

16:32.000 --> 16:36.799
to fulfil whatever destiny I can,

16:37.120 --> 16:45.519
to contribute in a meaningful way to the world around me.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.439
I'm sure that many Christians would agree with this also, as would many of the Judaic faith,

16:58.240 --> 17:00.000
and other faiths around the world.

17:06.799 --> 17:25.440
In Gaza, at the moment, we witness how the leader of an army might regard the whole population as subhuman,

17:26.320 --> 17:38.880
simply because a group of people called Hamas, an armed dictatorship that kills dissidents,

17:39.920 --> 17:44.799
has controlled the population and embedded itself among them.

17:45.519 --> 17:57.440
And in its turn Hamas views

18:00.159 --> 18:07.440
every Jewish person living in Israel as subhuman, to be murdered and enslaved.

18:15.599 --> 18:21.200
But this situation arose out of a concept called land ownership.

18:22.799 --> 18:35.440
And land ownership is a theme I will deal with in my first book called Extinction Avoidance.

18:36.320 --> 18:48.320
As a final criticism of the current leader of the military

18:50.160 --> 19:00.000
that evidence indicates has committed war crimes within the Gaza Strip against a civilian population,

19:00.319 --> 19:18.000
I should add the Jewish canon specifies that not more than one eye should be taken as revenge

19:19.200 --> 19:20.640
for one eye:

19:21.200 --> 19:36.240
that retribution should be limited in scope to that which has been inflicted upon the initial victim.

19:37.039 --> 19:50.559
I believe that the numbers of civilian casualties, the lack of water, the lack of food,

19:51.599 --> 19:59.359
the lack of shelter, and the sheer economic damage that is happening in the region

19:59.679 --> 20:09.519
might be considered to constitute more than one eye for one eye.

20:17.679 --> 20:27.359
This is the end of this introductory book entitled Rivers of imprisonment.

20:29.359 --> 20:31.359
The end.
