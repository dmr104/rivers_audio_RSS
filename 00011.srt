1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,599
This bank was established in 1609, under what Smith called "the guarantee of the city",

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,559
under the supervision, and direction, of 4 Burgomasters, who were trustworthy respectable

3
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:28,879
individuals from the city; and each directing Burgomaster, all 4 of them, are changed each year.

4
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,079
Each new set of Burgomasters counts the gold in the bank, compares it with the books the bank

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,320
is keeping, and delivers the bank's books, and reserve of gold and silver, to the new set of

6
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,119
Burgomasters, who receive the same upon oath.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,840
Smith said, "...in that sober and religious country, oaths are not yet disregarded."

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,760
Smith also said, "Amidst all the revolutions which faction has ever occasioned in the

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,520
government of Amsterdam, the prevailing party has at no time accused their predecessors of

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:27,040
infidelity in the administration of the bank. No accusation could have affected more deeply

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,280
the reputation and fortune of the disgraced party; and if such an accusation could have been supported,

12
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,079
we may be assured that it would have been brought." (End quotation).

13
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,280
When money, in either coin, or bullion, was deposited with the bank, the bank would give

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,359
credit in its books, typically 5% below the market price of bullion.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,840
This 5% was called the agio. What does this mean?

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,680
Recall from our previous discussion about apples being directly bartered for money,

17
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,199
that if the price of apples doubles, but the price of money remains the same,

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,359
then twice as much money can be had for the same amount of apples:

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,959
which is the same thing as saying that half as many apples will exchange by the same amount of money than before.

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,759
The credit the bank gives in its books

21
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,479
is known as the bank price of bullion:

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,719
it is typically 5% below the market price of bullion. This is known as the agio.

23
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:23,520
If, however, the money deposited toward the bank was in the form of clipped, and worn, coin,

24
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,560
which is diminished currency, from the neighbouring states, then in the example of the bank of

25
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Hamburg, not Amsterdam, the supposed difference between the old, clipped, worn, coins, (quote) "poured

26
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,840
into it from all the neighbouring states" (end quote), and the new, freshly minted, currency,

27
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,800
of the state of Hamburg, was 14%.

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,600
That is, the worth, or the cost, of the newly minted coin, was 14%

29
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:10,319
above the worth of the old worn, clipped, and debased, coin, from other nations.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,439
That is to say, the price of the new freshly minted coin of Hamburg, the state of Hamburg,

31
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:35,519
to which the city of Hamburg belonged, was 14% higher than that of the price of the old,

32
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,279
debased, worn, clipped, coin, which was flooding in to the city of Hamburg from the surrounding states.

33
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,240
What was of value was the estimated amount of gold and silver contained therein.

34
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:04,240
Here, Smith makes no mention of the bank of Hamburg issuing bank money as credits upon anybody's

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,759
account; so I presume that this service was not offered by the bank of Hamburg.

36
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:26,399
To illustrate this diagrammatically further, let us say that 50 pounds worth of clipped coin would

37
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:38,079
exchange for 100 bushels of wheat. Then, we would say that the price of the clipped coin was lower

38
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:49,199
than that of the freshly minted coin, because only 43 pounds of the freshly minted coin would exchange

39
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:59,360
for 100 bushels of wheat. Thus, that which has a higher price, i.e. the freshly minted coin,

40
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,959
would be of a lesser amount when the bushels of wheat were fixed in amount.

41
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:17,519
That which had a lower price, such as the clipped coin, would exchange in a greater amount for 100

42
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:27,279
bushels of wheat. Here I have used a difference between the price in money of the clipped coin,

43
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,759
and the price in money of the freshly minted coin as 14%.

44
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:45,439
Recall that the words as "price", "worth" and "cost" can be used interchangeably, within the 18th century.

45
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:58,000
I now must tell you of a profitable ruse which Smith warns us operated in England.

46
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:10,079
The seignorage is the price paid for the cost of minting any form of gold into golden sovereigns.

47
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,399
Initially, the old coin, or bullion which may have been of doubtful purity and authenticity,

48
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,399
or, gold plate, cups, trophies, jewellery, etc. was melted.

49
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,039
This allowed the separation of the gold from the other metals it was mixed with.

50
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:44,959
Then, the Royal Mint would mix the gold with the other metals in the correct proportions

51
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:52,319
for the composition of a gold sovereign, which would be formed.

52
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,759
The cost of this work, the seignorage, was paid for by the English crown,

53
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,279
i.e. the revenues received by the state, by taxation: such as malt duties,

54
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,319
and taxes imposed upon the importation of goods, etc.

55
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:27,040
The idea was to distribute, and freely intermingle, these new coins, with the older ones.

56
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,480
But, there was no realistic way to collect, and filter out, all the older ones.

57
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,120
In fact, there was a profitable reason why the newer ones were filtered out and removed from

58
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:48,799
circulation; and this reason was that if Mr Joe Bloggs could get in his hand a large number of these

59
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,440
new, freshly minted, coins, he could melt them down into bullion, and then take that bullion

60
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,519
to the Royal Mint, to be re-minted into new, freshly minted, coin. This happened because the Royal Mint

61
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:21,439
bought at the price of the old, worn, clipped, coin, which was priced at, say, 9% lower than the new,

62
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:30,000
freshly, minted coin, from the Royal Mint. So long as the market price of gold bullion

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,480
was less than the mint price of the new coin, the person committing this ruse

64
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,679
would be buying low, and selling high: thus making a profit.

65
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:56,480
To explain this further, let the weight of pure gold be one ounce in weight within

66
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:05,360
freshly minted coin from the mint, and say this gold has been stamped with a denomination of

67
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:20,000
46 pounds 72 and a half pence. Mr Joe Bloggs can now melt this down, into, say, bullion which is worth

68
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,200
48 pounds, and sell this to the mint for 48 pounds, which is the price at which the mint

69
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,279
buys bullion, in order to create the denominated value of 46 pounds 72 and a half pence of freshly

70
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:52,959
minted coin. That one ounce in weight of gold has the worth of, say, 1000 bushels of wheat.

71
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:02,159
He would be selling it for the worth of, say, 1026 bushels of wheat, and pocketing the difference.

72
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:13,360
That is to say, he receives his one ounce in pure gold, in the form of a denomination

73
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:25,679
of 46 pounds and 72 pence; but after he has melted this into plate, jewellery, or bullion, he can sell it

74
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:42,079
for 48 pounds. The Royal Mint will issue 46 pounds 72 and a half pence of denominated value

75
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,159
for every 50 pounds of old clipped and worn denominated value it receives.

76
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:59,439
This is what the Royal Mint is attempting to do. The Royal Mint also buys in bullion,

77
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:13,600
plate, and jewellery, and melts that down. Mr Joe Bloggs would, in effect, be buying a

78
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,840
certain amount of gold at a lower price, and selling it at a higher price.

79
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:41,040
The denominated worth of the received, newly freshly minted coin, would be lower than the worth of the gold

80
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:52,480
bullion which was brought to the Mint; and by melting down the new freshly minted coin into

81
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:08,480
bullion, a profit could be realistically made. You should know that 46 pounds : 14 :

82
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:23,920
6, signifies the stamped denomination as 46 pounds, 14 shillings, and 6 pence, where 20 shillings equal

83
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:39,360
one pound, and 12 d (12 pence) equal one shilling. 46 pounds, 14 shillings, and 6 pence, of new, freshly

84
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:54,240
minted coin, would contain the same amount of silver as 50 pounds of old clipped worn coin.

85
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,519
The difference being approximately 8% in this case.

86
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:09,919
At the same time, the market price of silver bullion would vary between

87
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,039
47 pounds, 14 shillings, and 48 pounds.

88
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:34,559
So, the trickster would be buying an amount of silver at a low price, 46 pounds, 14 shillings,

89
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:45,279
and 6 pence, and selling it for a higher price, between 47 pounds, 14 shillings, and 48 pounds;

90
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:56,319
thus making a profit. I quote from book 4 chapter 6 entitled Of Treaties of Commerce.

91
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,360
"The operations of the Mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of Penelope;

92
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,360
the work that was done in the day was undone in the night.

93
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,879
The mint was employed, not so much in making daily additions to the coin,

94
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,919
as in replacing the very best part of it, which was daily melted down."

95
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,039
(End quote).

96
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,719
Even if the seignorage was paid by the private individual who brought the gold to the Mint

97
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:49,279
to be coined, as happened in France, this ruse might still be possible if the

98
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:58,079
Mint price of the fresh coin would be higher than the market price of bullion:

99
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,439
sufficiently so to take into account the seignorage.

100
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:13,759
Imagine the difference between 46 pounds, 14 shillings, 6 pence, and 48 pounds, being the cost of

101
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:22,480
the seignorage. Thus, if the new freshly minted coin becomes melted into ingots, and returned to

102
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,439
the French Mint, this would no longer be profitable for our trickster to do so.

103
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:40,480
Smith again. "The seignorage will in many cases take away altogether,

104
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,279
and it will in all cases diminish the profit of melting down the new coin.".

105
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,480
But if the seignorage was too great, there lay an alternative peril, which was that of counterfeit

106
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:07,120
money, i.e. a fraudster money-counterfeiter would construct a coin which looked like a gold sovereign,

107
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,759
and would pass for one in circulation, but which contained far less gold than a genuine one from

108
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:24,319
the Royal Mint. It is possible, and likely in my view, though Smith does not mention this,

109
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:33,119
that, when fresh newly minted Dutch coin was minted from old, devalued, clipped, worn coin, from

110
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:41,839
all states, all places, all nations, that the bank had exclusive access towards obtaining this

111
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,919
(quote) "good and true money" (end quote). I say this because of the following quotation

112
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,559
from Wealth of Nations, book four, chapter three, part one, Digression:

113
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:08,000
"As a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market than one of our common worn shillings,

114
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:19,599
so the good and true money which might be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private

115
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:28,000
person, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the country, would be of no

116
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,639
more value than that currency, from which it could no longer be readily distinguished.

117
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,199
While it remained in the coffers of the bank, its superiority was known and ascertained.

118
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:53,680
When it had come into those of a private person, its superiority could not well be ascertained

119
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,880
without more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth.

120
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:10,880
By being brought from the coffers of the bank, besides, it lost all the other advantages of bank

121
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:21,760
money; its security, its ease and safe transferability, its use in paying foreign bills of exchange."

122
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:35,760
(end quote). In the following quotation from the same section, when Smith refers to "this bank",

123
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:42,000
he is referring to the bank of Amsterdam established in 1609, not the bank of Hamburg.

124
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:51,920
(start quote) "This bank received both foreign coin, and the light worn coin of the country,

125
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,480
at its real intrinsic value in the good standard money of the country,

126
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:07,759
deducting only so much as was necessary for defraying the expense of coinage

127
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,839
and the other necessary expense of management." (end quote).

128
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:27,039
When Smith says the words as "real intrinsic value", he infers that which the amount of gold

129
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:39,119
contained therein, will exchange for. So, this is our concept as "cost", and also our concept as

130
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:47,200
"worth", from the 18th century. I'm sorry to have used the word "value" without defining it yet; but

131
00:20:47,200 --> 00:21:03,840
I will do in due course. Treat this as a spoiler. When Smith says (quote) "good standard money of the

132
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:12,880
country" (end quote), he is referring to the fresh (quote) "good" (end quote), coin which is minted from

133
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:22,560
this gold by the Dutch Mint, and is of a weight and purity guaranteed by the state which Amsterdam

134
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:36,080
is part of. The word as "defray" means to pay, or to cover the costs of. Smith continues: (quote)

135
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:46,559
"For the value which remained after this small deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books.

136
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:58,000
This credit was called bank money, which, as it represented money exactly according to the standard

137
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:10,400
of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically worth more than current money." (end quote)

138
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:26,560
The bank was not intended to be an institution which makes too much profit.

139
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,120
It charges for its administration costs, and the cost of storing the gold which is brought to it.

140
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,560
We are told that the (quote) "worth" (end quote) of bank money was (quote) "intrinsically

141
00:22:49,600 --> 00:23:05,120
worth more than current money" (end quote), i.e. worth more than the (quote) "light and worn coin of the

142
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:22,000
country" (end quote). In the same section I quote: "It was at the same time enacted, that all bills drawn

143
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,839
upon or negotiated at Amsterdam, of the value of 600 guilders and upwards, should be paid in bank money,

144
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:34,639
which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of those bills.

145
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:44,480
Every merchant, in consequence of this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank,

146
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,879
