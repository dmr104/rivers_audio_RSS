00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
I now quote directly from chapter 24 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.920
The removal of Saint Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.320
His subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperor's steps

00:23.320 --> 00:29.440
from Constantinople to Antioch; and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the

00:29.440 --> 00:34.359
injudicious attempt to relieve their distress.

00:34.359 --> 00:39.600
The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria; and the price of bread,

00:39.600 --> 00:46.359
in the markets of Antioch, had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn.

00:46.359 --> 00:54.120
But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly.

00:54.119 --> 00:59.479
In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his

00:59.479 --> 01:06.079
exclusive property, is used by another as a lucrative object of trade, and is required

01:06.079 --> 01:11.560
by a third for the daily and necessary support of life; all the profits of the intermediate

01:11.560 --> 01:18.000
agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.519
The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and

01:23.519 --> 01:33.799
anxiety; and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine.

01:33.799 --> 01:41.079
When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian

01:41.079 --> 01:46.879
publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine,

01:46.879 --> 01:54.039
oil, and bread; but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for

01:54.039 --> 01:59.759
the subsistence of his people.

01:59.759 --> 02:05.120
With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing

02:05.120 --> 02:10.319
by legal authority, the value of corn.

02:10.319 --> 02:17.400
He enacted that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which had seldom

02:17.400 --> 02:24.359
been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his

02:24.359 --> 02:33.280
laws, he sent into the market 422,000 modii, or measures, which were drawn by his order

02:33.280 --> 02:40.840
from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis and even of Egypt.

02:40.840 --> 02:47.319
The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt.

02:47.319 --> 02:51.840
The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants;

02:51.840 --> 02:58.599
the proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the

02:58.599 --> 03:03.199
small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal

03:03.199 --> 03:06.000
price.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.799
Julian still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people

03:10.799 --> 03:17.560
as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy,

03:17.560 --> 03:22.799
though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus.

03:22.799 --> 03:31.719
The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.

03:31.719 --> 03:38.840
He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands,

03:38.840 --> 03:46.280
or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country;

03:46.280 --> 03:51.159
and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense, not of public

03:51.159 --> 03:54.599
duty, but of private interest.

03:54.599 --> 03:59.719
The whole body, consisting of 200 of the most noble and wealthy citizens, were sent under

03:59.719 --> 04:05.439
a guard from the palace to the prison; and, though they were permitted, before the close

04:05.439 --> 04:10.280
of evening, to return to their respective houses, the emperor himself could not obtain

04:10.280 --> 04:15.639
the forgiveness which he had so easily granted.

04:15.639 --> 04:21.759
The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints, which were industriously

04:21.759 --> 04:27.560
circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks.

04:27.560 --> 04:32.319
During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent

04:32.319 --> 04:37.399
songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the personal conduct, and even the beard of

04:37.399 --> 04:42.360
the emperor; and the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates

04:42.360 --> 04:43.920
and the applause of the multitude.
