1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,039
Part four, Promissory notes (which are paper money), and commercial banks.

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:24,320
Within Wealth of Nations, Book Two, Chapter Two, Of Money, Adam Smith wrote,

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:48,320
"Some years ago, the different banking companies of Scotland were in the practice of inserting into their bank notes what they called an optional clause; by which they promised payment to the bearer,

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:01:10,319
either as soon as the note should be presented, or, in the option of the directors, six months after such presentment, together with the legal interest for the said six months.

5
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:34,319
The directors of some of those banks sometimes took advantage of this optional clause, and sometimes threatened those who demanded gold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their notes, that they would take advantage of it,

6
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:44,319
unless such demanders would content themselves with a part of what they demanded.

7
00:01:45,319 --> 00:02:03,319
The promissory notes of those banking companies constituted, at that time, the far greater part of the currency of Scotland,

8
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:20,319
which this uncertainty of payment necessarily degraded below value of gold and silver money.

9
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:41,319
During the continuance of this abuse (which prevailed chiefly in 1762, 1763 and 1764), while the exchange between London and Carlisle was at par,

10
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:58,319
that between London and Dumfries would sometimes be four per cent. against Dumfries, though this town is not thirty miles distant from Carlisle.

11
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:06,319
But at Carlisle, bills were paid in gold and silver;

12
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:27,319
whereas at Dumfries, they were paid in Scotch bank notes; and the uncertainty of getting these bank notes exchanged for gold and silver coin, had thus degraded them, four per cent. below the value of that coin.

13
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:40,319
The same act of parliament, which suppressed ten and five shilling bank notes, suppressed likewise this optional clause,

14
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:55,319
and thereby restored the exchange between England and Scotland to its natural rate, or to what the course of trade and remittances might happen to make it."

15
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,319
(end quote).

16
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,319
Within the same chapter, Smith also said,

17
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:22,319
"It is not by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be so, that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the industry of the country."

18
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:30,319
(end quote).

19
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:38,319
Maybe I read that passage too fast.

20
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,319
I repeat it here.

21
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,319
(quote).

22
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,319
(end quote).

23
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,319
Smith also said,

24
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:39,319
"When we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating capital of any society can employ,

25
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:54,319
we must always have regard to those parts of it only which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work;

26
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:08,319
the other, which consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those three, must always be deducted."

27
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,319
(end quote).

28
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,319
The quantity of money must always be deducted from the circulating capital,

29
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
Smith infers.

30
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,319
I understand this may be confusing.

31
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,319
I will address this confusion after finishing this quotation.

32
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,319
I quote,

33
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:52,319
"In order to put industry into motion, three things are requisite;

34
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:09,319
materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the wages or recompense for the sake of which the work is done.

35
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:20,319
Money is neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with;

36
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:29,319
and though the wages of the workmen are commonly paid to him in money,

37
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:44,319
his real revenue, like that of all other men, consists, not in the money, but in the money's worth;

38
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:53,319
not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them."

39
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
(end quote).

40
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:10,319
Now I will re-read this passage at a faster tempo.

41
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,319
"In order to put industry into motion, three things are requisite;

42
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:32,319
materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the wages or recompense for the sake of which the work is done.

43
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:41,319
Money is neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with;

44
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,320
and though the wages of the workmen are commonly paid to him in money,

45
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:59,320
his real revenue, like that of all other men, consists, not in the money, but in the money's worth;

46
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:08,320
not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them."

47
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
(end quote).

48
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Smith tells us that circulating capital is composed of four parts:

49
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:35,320
one, provisions; two, materials; three, finished work; and four, money.

50
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:51,320
He tells us that only the first three -- provisions, materials, and finished work --

51
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:01,320
are useful in computing how much quantity of industry, i.e. the intelligent performance of human labour,

52
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,320
happens because of the circulating capital of any society.

53
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:28,320
He says we must disregard the part as money from the circulating capital if we are to look at how many people are currently employed.

54
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Provisions might compose of electricity, oil, gas, water, fodder for my horse.

55
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Materials may compose of flour for a baker, leather for a shoemaker.

56
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:12,320
And finished work may be the shoemaker's shoes, the breadmaker's bread.

57
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Without finished work, no enterprise can sell its finished work, and so it cannot attain revenue,

58
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,320
and it cannot make profit out of its revenue.

59
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Now for some basic definitions taken from Smith.

60
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I will state what these are, as I believe I can achieve a greater level of didacism instead of quoting his work directly.

61
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:57,320
The words as "real wealth" mean something tangibly material, i.e. an actual item of value:

62
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:09,320
where the word "value" means the substance and form of an object which supplies the wants and pleasures of mankind,

63
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,320
as taken from Edward Gibbon, Decline and Fall, Chapter 71, Part 3.

64
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:28,320
So real wealth means something tangibly material, something I can possess,

65
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,320
something which is the product of the intelligent performance of human labour.

66
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:57,320
It does not consist of coin or notes necessarily, but in the worth that these coins or notes can be had in exchange by.

67
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:11,320
The words as "neat revenue" comprehend how much stuff gets to where it is needed to be consumed,

68
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:22,320
be that a house which becomes bought, or food, or clothes; but not a bridge, nor a road, nor a sewage system,

69
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:32,320
because these are not usually created by private individuals to be owned by specific parties.

70
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:50,320
The cost of labour is the worth of the wages that an employer pays to the employee.

71
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:12,320
The worth of these wages is the amount of real wealth which the employee may purchase by his wages.

72
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:23,320
His wages are his recompense for the labour he performs.

73
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:37,320
The price of labour is the amount of money that the employee is paid.

74
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:58,320
If the price of living is very high, the worker may live a hand-to-mouth existence,

75
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:17,320
i.e. she places the whole worth of her wages inside her stock reserved for immediate consumption.

76
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,320
I denote this by the phrase "hand-to-mouth wages".

77
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:42,320
If Wendy lives like this, in her case her whole wage forms part of the neat revenue of the society.

78
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Excluding the possibility of nationalised production of coal, gas, electricity, telephony, etc. from our viewpoint,

79
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,320
as these all produce a vendible commodity -- coal, electricity, gas, steel, etc. --

80
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:11,320
all other forms of taxpayer spending, such as doctors, teachers, police, prison officers, judges, etc.,

81
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
don't produce something vendible.

82
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:25,320
And I say these public services, to avoid stymying the wealth of a nation,

83
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:40,320
should be paid for exclusively by the expense of one, and only one, form of taxation called PET: personal expenditure tax.

84
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:54,320
The reason why this is the case forms the subject matter of these three books further to this introduction.

85
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:08,320
If it be taken that stock and unfettered private initiative and enterprise, which is not necessarily the same thing as ownership,

86
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,320
causes businesses which produce vendible commodities,

87
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,320
then those businesses generate two forms of neat revenue.

88
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:35,319
First, is the part of the worker's wage, which the worker spends upon her stock reserved for immediate consumption;

89
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,319
within the case of Wendy: experiencing hand-to-mouth wages.

90
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:57,319
And the second part as neat revenue, which unfettered private initiative and enterprise generates,

91
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:07,319
is the actual stuff she produces as a consequence of her work, which is consumed by other people,

92
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:15,319
i.e. all commodities, shoes, corn, consumer electronics, houses, etc.

93
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:28,319
When a society within a nation builds a hospital or a bridge,

94
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:40,319
this comprehends part of the gross revenue of all inhabitants of that country.

95
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,319
It is not really consumed by anybody.

96
00:18:47,319 --> 00:19:08,319
What is consumed is proportional to the neat revenue of all inhabitants of that country,

97
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:21,319
which is proportional to their real wealth: that which is tangible, and tangibly material;

98
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:30,319
an actual item of substance and form which supplies the wants and pleasures of mankind.

99
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:47,319
A house is a commodity, which comprehends part of the neat revenue of the inhabitants of a great country,

100
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:56,319
because the house initially was produced by private enterprise and initiative,

101
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,319
which I hasten to add is not the same concept as ownership.

102
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:10,319
And so when it got delivered to the consumer, who moved to the house (obviously it didn't move itself),

103
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,319
it was treated as a commodity.

104
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,319
When I say that unfettered private initiative and enterprise:

105
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:35,319
unfettered in an unchained sense

106
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:52,319
but within reasonably devised planning laws, and laws to prevent criminal activities such as drugs and guns;

107
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:06,319
when I refer to unfettered private initiative and enterprise being not necessarily the same thing as ownership,

108
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,319
and very different to the concept of ownership,

109
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,319
I might cite the example that a slave is owned,

110
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,319
but a slave's labour is not an example of private enterprise.

111
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:31,319
An argumentative person may tell me that the slave owner, or slave trader, was an example of private enterprise,

112
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:44,319
but I would reply to that by saying that the choice of labour which the slave performs is not that of private initiative,

113
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:53,319
but that of the slave being controlled by some type of a master, or a central planner.

114
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:06,319
In any case, whether slavery be achieved via economic controls written into law,

115
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,319
pertaining to taxation and land ownership,

116
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:20,319
or via the use of armaments and brute force, brutality and human rights abuses,

117
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:30,319
we can say that neither is the most perfect and obvious system of natural liberty.
