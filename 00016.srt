1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
The expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great society is that of maintaining

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:22,679
the motorways, the sewage works, the schools, doctors' surgeries, hospitals, prisons, rubbish

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:38,439
disposal, among other infrastructures. From the Wealth of Nations, book 2, chapter 2, Of

4
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:52,640
Money, I quote, "The expence of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country, may very properly

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:06,319
be compared to that of repairs in a private estate. The expence of repairs may frequently be

6
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:19,319
necessary for supporting the produce of the estate." (end quote). i.e. The less money becomes

7
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,399
spent upon maintaining the highways via a cost-cutting improvement, the more funds become

8
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:35,079
available to spend upon doctors' wages. This is a basic elementary fact which each political

9
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,799
party claims to be able to do better than the other within the mainstream political discussions

10
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:59,280
at present. Each political party claims to have more efficient ways to maintain and implement

11
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:13,000
public services and the way these are facilitated. Margaret Thatcher possibly comprehended this

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,759
point Smith made almost exclusively. Margaret Thatcher was a devotee of John Maynard Keynes.

13
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:34,079
She revealed this in her speech the day following the night of the Brighton Bombings, 12th October,

14
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:47,719
1984. The fundamental political idea which has been banded about has been if more efficient ways

15
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:54,879
to maintain and implement public services are facilitated, then hopefully these more efficient

16
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:05,960
public services will have a price tag which is less, and won't be achieving less in actual service

17
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:24,840
delivery. Within the following paragraph Smith continued, "But though the whole expence of

18
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:34,080
maintaining the fixed capital is thus necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society,

19
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,199
it is not the same case with that of maintaining the circulating capital".

20
00:03:43,199 --> 00:04:08,599
(end quote). Smith is saying that what is consumed is part of the neat capital, and when bridges,

21
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:22,439
motorways, hospitals are maintained, there is not a consumer consuming the end product of the human

22
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:42,480
labour which maintains these national infrastructures. So the expense of maintaining the fixed capital

23
00:04:42,480 --> 00:05:00,240
is thus necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society. Recall that the neat revenue

24
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:16,560
comprehends how much stuff gets to where it is needed to be consumed. Smith states, and I

25
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:31,199
paraphrase, "The real wealth of all the inhabitants of a great country is in proportion not to their

26
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:48,039
gross but to their neat revenue". Smith defines gross revenue in the following quotation. "The gross

27
00:05:48,040 --> 00:06:01,280
revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends the whole annual produce of their

28
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:24,439
land and labour;" (end quote). So the gross revenue includes the neat revenue and also the deduction

29
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:36,560
involved in the maintenance of bridges, motorways, hospitals and their constructions. It is not

30
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:47,879
measurable in terms of gross domestic product; it is measurable in tangible assets such as buildings,

31
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:59,879
bridges. It is the consequences of the intelligent performance of human labour having been done.

32
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:14,120
We have that the fixed capital within a great society is the motorways, the hospitals, the

33
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:38,519
schools, prisons, public buildings. Smith has told us that the maintenance of the circulating

34
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:51,240
capital is not necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society. In the following

35
00:07:51,240 --> 00:08:13,040
quotations the following diagram may help. Draw three circles each representing a point in a triangle.

36
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:32,920
The circles are not inside each other and don't overlap. One of these circles is the set as "circulating

37
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:50,240
capital". An arrow leaves this circle towards another circle called "maintenance upon fixed capital".

38
00:08:50,240 --> 00:09:10,320
Another arrow leaves circulating capital arriving at the remaining empty circle within which you may

39
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:32,360
write "neat revenue equals stock reserved for immediate consumption". Now draw one big circle around the

40
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:49,879
whole lot, and label this outer set "gross revenue of a society of a great country".

41
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:18,399
As Smith continues, when he refers to "this latter capital" he is referring to the circulating capital,

42
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:39,439
as opposed to the fixed capital. I quote, "Of the four parts of which this latter capital is composed,

43
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:53,480
money, provisions, materials, and finished work, the last three, it has already been observed,

44
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:10,519
are regularly withdrawn from it, and placed either in the fixed capital of the society,

45
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:28,559
or in their stock reserved for immediate consumption. Whatever portion of those consumable goods is not

46
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:42,599
employed in maintaining the former, goes all to the latter, and makes part of the neat revenue of the society."

47
00:11:42,600 --> 00:12:05,639
Smith is doing accountancy here. Not to disparage Smith or accountants. But if a factory owner

48
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:26,679
maintains the roof on his factory, or builds a new building, this would be an investment within his fixed capital.

49
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:43,719
The revelation which many people, economists even, may find it hard to believe is that this investment

50
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:53,759
within his fixed capital is paid for out of provisions, materials and finished work.

51
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:18,799
The finished work his factory produces is sold for money, and part of this money is used to pay for provisions

52
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:29,839
and materials. Provisions might be the electricity and fuel and water his factory requires to run.

53
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:43,839
Materials might be bricks, beams, steel, machinery, in order to construct his factory.

54
00:13:48,839 --> 00:14:04,839
The finished work, the sale of it, generates the funds requisite for the provisions and the materials.

55
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:19,840
So, the more his finished work is consumed, the more provisions and materials he is able to acquire in order to invest in his fixed capital.

56
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,840
But if he doesn't need any more factory machinery, at this present time,

57
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:55,840
if his roof is fine and his buildings stand proud, then the revenue obtained by the sale of his finished products, after he has used parts of this revenue to pay for the replenishment of provisions and materials,

58
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
becomes his profit.

59
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:23,840
And if he doesn't take funds out of this profit to invest in new factories, then this neat revenue is his stock reserved for immediate consumption.

60
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:34,840
He might buy a yacht. He might be the consumer who buys a yacht.

61
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:59,840
So, the circulating capital can either, in the process of becoming regenerated, generate some fixed capital, or it can regenerate itself, and in the process of doing so, create some neat revenue: some stock reserved for the immediate consumption.

62
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,840
All of this is the gross revenue of a society of a great country.

63
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,840
You might ask, what about the wages the workers of the factory require to be paid?

64
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Well, this falls under the category of provisions.

65
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:51,840
He needs to provide the wages for the workers in the same way that he needs to provide the payment to acquire electricity, or fuel, or water.

66
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Of course, he will need materials to work upon if he is in the factory business.

67
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,840
He may need metal. He may need wood. He may need cloth.

68
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:35,839
The point Smith is making, and the point I would like to reinforce, is that the circulating capital consists of four parts.

69
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:48,839
One, provisions. Two, materials. Three, finished work. And four, money.

70
00:17:48,839 --> 00:18:17,839
As money serves only to circulate the previous three, it must always be deducted from the circulating capital, when we consider, and when we compute the quantity of industry, which the circulating capital of any society

71
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:33,839
can employ. Basically, when we assess how many people shall be employed, and where the employment comes from, we should not look at money.

72
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:41,839
We should look at finished goods. We should look at materials, and we should look at provisions.

73
00:18:41,839 --> 00:19:10,839
Provisions includes the ability to employ others, and if that is made difficult by the state, or made unviable due to hidden factors, then the provision as labour becomes greatly inhibited within a factory setting.

74
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:21,839
Let me, again, paraphrase the quotation from Smith.

75
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:50,839
"But though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is necessarily excluded from neat revenue of a society, we can't say the same thing about circulating capital, because of the four parts which this circulating capital is composed,

76
00:19:51,839 --> 00:20:07,839
only provisions, materials, and finished work, it has been observed, are regularly withdrawn from the circulating capital.

77
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:27,839
And if they don't contribute towards infrastructure, they must contribute towards the stock reserved for immediate consumption.

78
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:49,839
Whatever portion of consumable goods is not employed in maintaining the fixed capital, the infrastructure, goes all to the latter --

79
00:20:49,839 --> 00:21:00,839
the stock reserved for immediate consumption -- and makes a part of the neat revenue of the society."

80
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,839
(I end my paraphrase).

81
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:14,839
Finished goods, cars, handbags, cutlery sets, or whatever, are bought and consumed.

82
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:30,839
Part of the revenue which is received upon the sale of these things is used to resupply the provisions and materials which were consumed in the production of said items.

83
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:57,839
The surplus revenue, i.e. profit, can be used to maintain existing plant, i.e. to buy better buildings or machinery, or this surplus revenue could be used to buy extra provisions, materials, or finished products to be stored as a tangible asset,

84
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:04,839
i.e. grain stores, or the purchase of Rolex watches to be kept in a bank safe.

85
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:22,839
Either would be an increase of the assets owned by private individuals, and more properly, the latter would be an increase in the neat revenue of that society, which in turn is proportional to the real wealth of that nation.

86
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:56,839
Smith continued, "The maintenance of those three parts of the circulating capital, therefore, withdraws no portion of the annual produce from the neat revenue of the society, besides what is necessary for maintaining the fixed capital."

87
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:22,839
i.e. what is not invested as consumable assets, such as houses, Rolex watches, gold ingots, grain stores, is invested in plant machinery, large factories, agricultural infrastructure, machines of transportation, etc.

88
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:43,839
Since the Second World War in Great Britain, many people have been expecting these things, i.e. heavy industry, which is the maintenance of, or investment in, fixed capital, to materialise from either business borrowing or governmental spending, but that is not where they originate from.

89
00:23:43,839 --> 00:24:12,839
I concur with Smith that heavy industry comes from what wealth is not consumed: either consumed immediately, or is consumed at the point of its initial purchase, like that of a house, a store of grain, or a pile of Rolex watches to be stored as an asset to be sold at a later stage.

90
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:41,839
Smith said, "In computing either the gross or the neat revenue of any society, we must always, from the whole annual circulation of money and goods, deduct

91
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:54,839
the whole value of the money, of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of either."

92
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:03,839
(end quote).

93
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:13,839
Smith has an enhanced perception of truth, which I say is accurate;

94
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:38,839
and this truth contradicts the known wisdom of modern economics today, which calculates the goods as revenue produced within the society as a function of the money which is circulated within the society.

95
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:56,839
The misguided modern economists all call this the "gross domestic product", and they are all incorrect.

96
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:16,839
Smith said, "The great wheel of circulation is altogether different from the goods which are circulated by means of it."

97
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:21,839
(end quote).

98
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:43,839
Smith tells us, "The revenue of the society consists altogether in those goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them."

99
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,839
(end quote).

100
00:26:49,839 --> 00:27:09,839
He says, "Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation, the great instrument of commerce, like all other instruments of trade,

101
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:27,839
though it makes a part, and a very valuable part, of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the society to which it belongs;

102
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:52,839
and though the metal pieces of which it is composed, in the course of their annual circulation, distribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him, they make themselves no part of that revenue."

103
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,839
(end quote).
