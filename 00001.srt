Message to a friend 10th September 2023:

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,080
Did you know that the pagan Roman emperor Julian fixed the price of corn by law in Antioch?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Then he tried to supply the market with corn at this price,

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,440
either from the state or via assets which he had control over.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,440
The landowners being a monopoly or oligarchy simply withheld the supplying of corn to the

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,080
market thus elevating the price, preferring to store it for the next year instead.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
Julian had all the landowners, the senate of Antioch, arrested and incarcerated for a very

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,120
small amount of time before he forgave them and let them go free again. State control in this way

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,159
reminds me of something akin to Soviet Russia, which caused a lot of starvation, especially

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:55,200
in the Ukraine. I see occasionally posters for communism put on walls in York, but these

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:04,079
are usually pulled down or defaced in a short time. A year earlier, on Friday the 21st October 2022,

12
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,640
I wrote to my friend, having completed my first pass of Keynes's general theory,

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,079
he has introduced me to Mummery and Hobson's Physiology of Industry 1889, which is wonderfully

14
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,719
written if in error in places. Each model depends upon underlying assumptions,

15
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,760
and political economy is about discerning truth within those.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,519
Re: Orwell's comments about another author, like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome was burning,

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,920
but playing it with his face turned towards the flames, I recalled that Orwell said this

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,359
about Henry Miller, who wrote Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn in the 1930s or thereabouts.

19
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,280
I say this because I perceive Western civilization as already reached the beginning of its end,

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,280
and the situation is very grave. A model based upon flawed underlying assumptions can be more

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,040
complex than, for example, no model at all. It can then produce a prediction which matches

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,120
an observation by incorrect reasons, a type 3 error, and become much feted, but nevertheless wrong

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,879
though. Very easy to get bogged down in a myriad of functions and statistics without knowing what

24
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,479
is relevant to be sought.
