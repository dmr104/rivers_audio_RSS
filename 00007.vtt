00:00.000 --> 00:08.679
Now I shall talk about the word as "cost".

00:08.679 --> 00:20.480
We put apples on the left side of the see-saw, and money on the right-hand side.

00:20.480 --> 00:27.679
Now, the cost of 10 apples was £1.

00:27.679 --> 00:31.800
The cost of apples doubles.

00:31.800 --> 00:41.640
Now, the cost of 10 apples is £2.

00:41.640 --> 00:49.799
Please draw a table, the same as the one you drew before.

00:49.799 --> 00:54.879
From left to right, the columns are apples and money.

00:54.880 --> 01:02.359
From top to bottom, the rows are apples and money, in that order.

01:02.359 --> 01:08.359
Now, we fill in the north-east cell.

01:08.359 --> 01:17.560
The ratio of one-to-one has been transformed into a ratio of one-to-two, apples to money.

01:24.879 --> 01:29.959
So far, so good.

01:29.959 --> 01:39.879
We now investigate whether the cell in the south-west position is identical,

01:39.879 --> 01:45.799
i.e. does it have a ratio of one-to-two after the transformation,

01:45.799 --> 02:00.519
when we invert the position of apples and money on the see-saw?

02:00.519 --> 02:15.319
We shall now put money on the left-hand side of the see-saw, and apples on the right.

02:15.319 --> 02:25.959
We investigate, using psychological words, linguistic possibilities.

02:25.959 --> 02:33.159
The cost of £1 is 10 apples.

02:33.159 --> 02:36.639
This is previous to any change.

02:36.639 --> 02:43.240
Now, after the change, the cost of money doubles.

02:43.240 --> 02:52.280
How many apples can £1 now purchase?

02:52.280 --> 03:01.360
I must point out that cost is not the cost of borrowing money from any central bank, or subsidiary bank.

03:01.360 --> 03:09.320
But we're treating the cost of £1 as a commodity in comparison to the cost of say $1 as a commodity.

03:09.319 --> 03:18.039
Treat money sterling like the cost of any commodity.

03:18.039 --> 03:32.680
An economist might say something like: the interest rate increases, reducing the cost of money;

03:32.680 --> 03:39.400
and the price of it should go down depending upon a demand curve.

03:39.400 --> 03:47.240
But we're not talking about anything of the sort.

03:47.240 --> 04:00.120
We're saying that where money is, say, a banana, the cost of one banana is 10 apples, previously.

04:00.120 --> 04:08.840
And if the cost of a banana doubles, how many apples can one banana now purchase?

04:08.840 --> 04:17.240
I'll give you time to pause to think about this.

04:17.240 --> 04:29.480
Well, the 20th century, the 21st century viewpoint, and the explanation of it, is that, previously, £1

04:29.480 --> 04:35.160
would buy 10 apples; so, the cost of each apple was 10 pence.

04:35.160 --> 04:43.560
And if the cost of money doubles, subsequently the cost of any apple becomes 20 pence.

04:43.560 --> 04:53.720
So, we can only buy five of them after this transformation in cost.

04:53.720 --> 04:59.320
So, what do we have in our south-west cell in our cost table?

04:59.320 --> 05:09.400
Well, if £1 can buy 10 apples previously, and only five after,

05:09.400 --> 05:14.440
that's the same as saying that £2 will buy 10 apples after.

05:14.439 --> 05:31.720
So, our ratio, from one-to-one money to apples, has become a ratio of two-to-one money to apples.

05:31.720 --> 05:37.159
But this is inconsistent with our north-east cell.

05:37.159 --> 05:41.480
Again, we have an inconsistency in the 20th century

05:41.480 --> 05:48.040
linguistic understanding: which is purely psychological, which exists entirely in our heads,

05:48.040 --> 05:53.000
and nowhere in external reality.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.240
So, we can already conclude that the 20th century viewpoint about the word "cost" is wrong.

05:59.240 --> 06:03.160
It is inconsistent: therefore it can't be true.

06:03.160 --> 06:10.280
The ratio is inverted depending on which position we put apples, and which position we put

06:10.279 --> 06:15.239
money, on which side of the see-saw. It is asymmetric.

06:15.239 --> 06:23.399
We don't have a symmetrical ratio within the given transformation.

06:23.399 --> 06:27.639
Now, the mystery is to examine which cell is correct:

06:27.639 --> 06:31.799
is it the north-east cell, or is it the south-west cell?

06:31.799 --> 06:36.119
To do this, we will need to examine the 18th century viewpoint,

06:36.120 --> 06:40.360
and hopefully it will be consistent. If it is consistent, we know it to be true;

06:42.199 --> 06:48.360
and this will reveal which one of our cells is the external reality.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.519
Please note that in the table for the 18th century price,

06:57.079 --> 07:04.920
both the south-west cell, and the north-east cell, have become transformed to

07:04.920 --> 07:08.600
the same ratio, which is one-to-two:

07:11.720 --> 07:20.840
that is one-to-two of the left-hand side to the right-hand side.

07:24.360 --> 07:31.240
It didn't matter whether we place apples, or money, on the left-hand side: we got the same result.

07:31.240 --> 07:38.120
The semantic meaning of the word "money" didn't change that in the 18th century.

07:38.120 --> 07:47.160
We note that it did in the 20th century, previously.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.880
I posit that

07:54.600 --> 08:03.640
the correct cell for the cost in the 20th century is the north-east cell.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.840
It's merely a speculation at this stage; and the reason I say that is because

08:11.799 --> 08:18.599
we have a seemingly non-absurd transformed ratio

08:18.599 --> 08:23.719
of one-to-two, apples to money, left-hand side to the right-hand side.

08:32.439 --> 08:36.039
I believe that words, and concepts, should have clearly definable

08:36.839 --> 08:41.559
meanings, as, indeed, should prepositions within sentences.

08:42.199 --> 08:47.240
I note that the prepositions within the English language have become very chaotic,

08:49.799 --> 08:54.519
and this transitional change within linguistics has occurred beginning of

08:54.519 --> 08:58.439
Victorian times, right through the 20th century, up until the present day.

08:59.320 --> 09:07.800
To examine the concept of money further,

09:09.560 --> 09:14.920
let us consider what money could have been thought of during most of the Iron Age,

09:14.920 --> 09:21.480
which was maybe a pound of iron ore, smelted from some mine.

09:21.639 --> 09:29.639
So, I'd like to examine the north-east cell first.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.840
The transformed ratio of the cost of apples, to the cost of money:

09:36.120 --> 09:42.600
which I've speculated, as a hypothesis, that it should be

09:44.759 --> 09:46.440
one-to-two, apples to money,

09:46.920 --> 09:54.360
exchangeable amount of; which is after the transformation.

09:58.120 --> 10:05.400
This makes linguistic sense as a concept, both in the 20th century, and indeed in the 18th century,

10:06.920 --> 10:11.960
because the cost of something is the amount on the right-hand side of the see-saw,

10:12.920 --> 10:16.600
when we put the something on the left-hand side.

10:19.320 --> 10:32.680
That is, if 10 apples on the left-hand side would cost one pound of iron ore on the right-hand side;

10:32.759 --> 10:45.000
then, if the cost of apples doubles, then we now require two pounds of iron ore to exchange

10:46.199 --> 10:52.199
by 10 apples. To put it another way,

10:54.679 --> 10:59.079
10 apples to exchange by two pounds of iron ore.

11:03.639 --> 11:09.559
Recall that we are treating iron as money: pounds of iron as money.

11:11.399 --> 11:20.359
Now invert these positions: put money, which is iron, on the left-hand side of the see-saw,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.199
and put apples on the right-hand side of the see-saw.

11:27.160 --> 11:39.800
So, we are saying that one pound of iron exchanges by 10 apples; and subsequent to a transformation,

11:39.800 --> 11:45.000
the cost of iron doubles.

11:45.879 --> 11:57.000
So, we can infer linguistically that whatever is on the right-hand side of the see-saw, which is apples,

11:57.879 --> 12:01.639
is now going to be required in double the amount to exchange

12:03.399 --> 12:08.679
for what is on the left-hand side of the see-saw: which is one pound of iron.

12:08.759 --> 12:16.519
So when the pound of iron, cost of, doubles, we now exchange by 20 apples.

12:17.799 --> 12:22.279
This is the 18th century viewpoint, and it is logically consistent.

12:22.279 --> 12:25.879
It is semantically consistent, and it is syntactically consistent.

12:29.159 --> 12:35.319
Money doesn't do anything special semantically to the syntax of the see-saw.

12:35.560 --> 12:44.920
It is symmetrical. So, the 18th century is correct; and my erstwhile hypothesis, which was that

12:47.400 --> 12:54.280
what is on the right-hand side of the see-saw doubles in amount, by the word "cost", when the

12:54.280 --> 13:00.360
cost doubles, of the substance on the left-hand side, seems sound.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.040
Recall I previously mentioned that the word "price"

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
doubles the amount on the right-hand side.

13:14.680 --> 13:19.480
Now, we can infer that the word "cost" doubles the amount that's on the right-hand side.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.120
We're forming a pretty picture, so far.

13:25.720 --> 13:31.640
But what is concerning is that the word "cost" in the 20th century is inconsistent.

13:32.519 --> 13:39.319
So, when we use the words "cost of money", or, indeed, the more modern syntax,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.639
which is the words as "cost to money",

13:44.199 --> 13:50.360
we are not hitting reality in the correct place:

13:51.319 --> 13:59.319
we're deluding ourselves, because when money is treated as a commodity, we fail.

14:02.600 --> 14:17.319
Money is no different to any other commodity, as an external reality, I say, anyway.

14:19.319 --> 14:23.319
Here ends my discussion of the word as "cost".
