00:00.000 --> 00:11.240
In the following quotation from Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, when the author uses the

00:11.240 --> 00:19.600
words as "nominal price", he has previously defined this to be the price in money which

00:19.600 --> 00:38.159
is paid. The quotation is taken from book 1, chapter 11, part 3, which is

00:38.159 --> 00:44.320
titled: "Digression concerning the variations in the value of silver

00:44.320 --> 00:51.600
during the course of the four last centuries." Recall that this book was

00:51.600 --> 01:04.319
published in the 1770s; so, the four last centuries are from 1300 onwards. I

01:04.319 --> 01:12.439
quote: "But the nominal sum which constitutes the market price of every

01:12.439 --> 01:21.879
commodity, is necessarily regulated, not so much by the quantity of silver which

01:21.879 --> 01:28.879
according to the standard ought to be contained in it, as by that which it is

01:28.879 --> 01:36.680
found by experience actually is contained in it. This nominal sum

01:36.680 --> 01:45.320
therefore is necessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and

01:45.320 --> 02:02.040
wearing, than when near to its standard value." End quote. Smith here is inferring

02:02.040 --> 02:10.640
that when the coin contains less silver than freshly minted silver coin, its

02:10.640 --> 02:22.719
worth, and hence Smith's understanding of its cost, is less.

02:25.360 --> 02:31.759
Hence money has now decreased in price.

02:32.039 --> 02:39.439
Note that in our previous examples, where we put the commodity under question on

02:39.439 --> 02:45.719
the left side of the see-saw, and then doubled its price, or doubled its cost,

02:45.719 --> 02:54.719
or doubled its worth, that when its price doubled, by the 18th century viewpoint,

02:54.719 --> 03:09.560
its cost doubled, and its worth doubled. And when its cost doubled, that is the

03:09.560 --> 03:14.599
cost of the item on the left-hand side of the see-saw, the ratio of one-to-one was

03:14.599 --> 03:23.400
transformed into a ratio of one-to-two: that is, the left-hand side of the see-saw

03:23.400 --> 03:26.879
to the right-hand side of the see-saw.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.840
In the 18th century viewpoint, when the cost halves, the worth also halves.

03:44.840 --> 03:55.120
We can infer that if the cost doubled, the ratio of one-to-one transformed into a

03:55.120 --> 04:04.599
ratio of one-to-two, left to right. But what is a ratio? It signifies the amount

04:04.599 --> 04:12.439
of something: the quantity of the item to be exchanged.

04:15.120 --> 04:22.879
Where the price doubled, the cost doubled. Where the price doubled, the worth

04:22.879 --> 04:34.199
doubled. The cost, and the worth, were equivalent by the 18th century viewpoint.

04:34.800 --> 04:45.320
So, likewise, if the price were to half, the cost would halve, thereby also halving

04:45.320 --> 04:48.520
the worth.

04:53.439 --> 05:02.879
Let us say that a bushel of wheat, instead of being paid for in freshly minted

05:02.879 --> 05:11.759
coin, is paid for in debased, clipped, worn coin.

05:15.839 --> 05:23.159
So, a bushel of wheat now costs more money because you need more of those coins

05:23.159 --> 05:32.040
stamped with a specific, clipped, and worn denomination in money, to acquire

05:32.960 --> 05:45.280
a fixed weight of silver. This presumes of course that the ratio between freshly

05:45.280 --> 05:53.240
minted silver coin, and bushels of wheat, remains unaltered.

05:54.240 --> 06:06.960
A specific, stamped, denomination of this worn, or clipped, silver coin affords fewer items of

06:07.199 --> 06:22.399
bushels of wheat because it will purchase less wheat. Therefore, a bushel of wheat now costs more money.

06:22.399 --> 06:34.120
Adam Smith did not think about money, or rationalise its price, and cost, in the same

06:34.160 --> 06:43.639
way that a 20th century individual did. The 20th century economist is a 20th

06:43.639 --> 06:51.720
century individual, and may very well believe that if the price of money rises

06:51.720 --> 07:03.040
that more money will exchange by a fixed number of bushels of wheat: thus, also

07:03.040 --> 07:11.760
believing that if the price of money falls, that less money will exchange by a fixed number of

07:11.920 --> 07:34.039
bushels of wheat. The 20th century viewpoint is not that of the 18th century: which is that if the price

07:34.040 --> 07:47.600
of money falls, its cost decreases, and hence more money will exchange by the same amount of wheat;

07:47.600 --> 07:57.320
so less wheat can be had for the same amount of money.

08:04.040 --> 08:23.840
To see this pictorially, imagine a vertical scale consisting of the amount of something.

08:24.839 --> 08:40.480
Previously, so much money, the amount of which is fixed, exchanges by the amount as say 10

08:40.480 --> 08:54.120
bushels of wheat. After the price of money falls, the amount of money which will exchange by 10

08:54.120 --> 09:13.799
bushels of wheat increases. So, the ratio has become altered: more money, a greater amount of it, is

09:14.399 --> 09:25.000
required to exchange by 10 bushels of wheat. So, 10 bushels of wheat will exchange by more money:

09:25.000 --> 09:40.919
which is the same as saying, that, for a fixed amount of money, fewer bushels of wheat, less than 10,

09:40.919 --> 09:51.360
will exchange by this fixed amount of money, after the price of money has fallen.
