Introduction -- part 3. The Bank of Amsterdam.

00:10.640 --> 00:17.719
The Bank of Amsterdam was established in the year 1609, in response to a problem which

00:17.719 --> 00:26.859
emerged in small states, such as Genoa, or Hamburg, whereby the local currency was not

00:26.859 --> 00:38.359
desirable for international trade, i.e. merchants did not wish to use it, and in preference

00:38.359 --> 00:45.439
they elected to use coins of neighbouring states which were more internationally recognised,

00:45.439 --> 00:53.200
and accepted, in foreign trade. In particular, coins such as the Mexico

00:53.200 --> 01:01.120
dollars was well trusted to have a specific well-known amount of silver of an ascertained

01:01.120 --> 01:12.320
purity. This was important because these coins, if so desired, could be melted down,

01:12.319 --> 01:23.000
and formed into bullion, or items such as trinkets, jewellery, snuff boxes, etc.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
People knew exactly how much silver was contained in a Mexico dollar, so it would have been

01:30.000 --> 01:39.280
more effective as a durable, portable thing, desirable in exchange, for which other commodities

01:39.280 --> 01:50.240
could be exchanged, i.e. bought. To addle this, there were also French crowns,

01:50.240 --> 02:02.040
Dutch guilders, and stivers, English silver coin, Ducatoons, Rix dollars, Portuguese

02:02.040 --> 02:20.240
coin, new Louis d'ors, old Louis d'ors, Ducats, among others. If a small state chose to reform

02:20.240 --> 02:30.439
its currency, melt down the old coin, and cast the gold or silver into new coin, while altering

02:30.439 --> 02:39.800
the ratio of precious metal to other metal, then this would not alter the fact that merchants

02:39.800 --> 02:49.360
did not wish to use this national currency in international trade. The myriad coins which

02:49.360 --> 02:56.479
were used in international trade each weighed something different to each other, and each

02:56.479 --> 03:07.439
had a different alleged purity of precious metal, which could not be guaranteed and ascertained

03:07.439 --> 03:16.120
without melting the coin down. Frauds might emerge where a coin had less gold than promised,

03:16.120 --> 03:28.360
and a merchant is an expert in trade, not in coins and metallurgy. He, she, one, needed

03:28.360 --> 03:37.319
some banking system whereby a fixed, known, quantity of gold, of guaranteed purity, could

03:37.319 --> 03:51.639
be reliably exchanged, readily. Prior to the introduction of paper money, which was originally

03:51.639 --> 04:01.799
instituted by numerous domestic commercial banks, unlike the Bank of Amsterdam; and prior

04:01.800 --> 04:13.719
to the institution of banks for international trade, like the Bank of Amsterdam, payments

04:13.719 --> 04:23.080
made by smaller merchants were orchestrated by what was called a merchant bill, drawn upon

04:23.079 --> 04:34.759
a large reputable trader, by an agent of this trader, for an additional fee. The system worked

04:34.759 --> 04:50.120
as follows. A small factory, or trader, in Manchester, wishes to lend some stock to a larger reputable

04:50.199 --> 04:58.920
merchant in London, such as a large wholesaler, or a large retailer. Both parties wish this

04:58.920 --> 05:08.920
vendible stock to be sold on to the consumer. This merchant in London is deemed trustworthy.

05:12.519 --> 05:18.920
And this trustworthy wholesaler in London does not pay upfront for this advanced stock,

05:19.800 --> 05:26.600
but draws up a bill of exchange, also known as a merchant's bill, which is an agreement

05:26.600 --> 05:33.080
that this large trustworthy firm will pay it within six months time, from hence.

05:37.639 --> 05:43.960
The small factory, or trader, in Manchester, is the supplier of stock.

05:44.919 --> 05:56.839
The larger reputable merchant in London has a debt to the small manufacturer in Manchester.

06:03.560 --> 06:11.079
Within six months time it is hoped that this stock has been sold to the consumer.

06:14.839 --> 06:25.079
So, the smaller manufacturer, is owed a certain amount, say 10 gold sovereign coins.

06:29.560 --> 06:38.279
This debt, this certificate as the merchant's bill, can be sold for nine and a half golden

06:38.279 --> 06:48.439
sovereigns, if the Manchester merchant desires to lose the difference, for immediate money;

06:52.919 --> 07:06.279
and the purchaser of this bill gains half a sovereign when the date of maturity arrives,

07:09.239 --> 07:11.239
and this money becomes payable.

07:14.199 --> 07:21.639
This is how the banking system operated before the establishment of banks where a trading

07:21.639 --> 07:26.759
individual was facilitated to have the keeping of a bank account.

07:29.639 --> 07:34.439
But here lay a subtle problem in international trade.

07:35.399 --> 07:43.160
A reputable London merchant would pay in English silver coin, and a reputable Paris merchant would

07:43.160 --> 07:45.399
pay in French silver coin.

07:53.800 --> 08:03.240
If there would have been more silver contained in the total weight of a certain number of

08:03.960 --> 08:12.360
English coin, in comparison with the total weight of a certain number of French coin,

08:13.879 --> 08:22.280
then it would be more profitable, for a merchant to obtain a bill upon a reputable London merchant,

08:22.280 --> 08:24.360
than a reputable French merchant.

08:24.600 --> 08:37.080
So this would encourage a French manufacturer to sell his stock in England, rather than in France;

08:42.680 --> 08:49.080
and also would encourage the English manufacturer to sell his stock in England, rather than in France.

08:49.800 --> 08:59.080
As a consequence, silver would leave England, and be taken to France.

09:06.040 --> 09:15.000
Silver, i.e. money, or cash, or hard currency today, always gravitates towards the place

09:15.720 --> 09:18.279
where industrious labour is being performed:

09:20.519 --> 09:27.320
for which stock is required, capital or material stock, to generate profit,

09:28.440 --> 09:32.279
and hence to employ workers within a profitable enterprise.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.759
But that is an aside for the present moment within this discussion.

09:55.399 --> 09:59.879
If more silver is obtained in England, than in France,

10:03.399 --> 10:06.679
the exchange is said to favour France,

10:07.319 --> 10:19.719
and is against England: whereby the French merchant is said to gain a premium,

10:20.279 --> 10:24.839
which is paid by the London merchant; and silver leaves England for France.

10:25.000 --> 10:37.879
Contrary to this, if more silver would be obtained in France than in London,

10:42.040 --> 10:48.440
then the French merchant who obtains English silver is said to give a premium,

10:49.480 --> 10:53.800
and the exchange is said to favour England, and be against France.

10:55.800 --> 11:01.560
This is the theory.

11:05.560 --> 11:13.320
In reality, before the reformation of the English silver coin in King William's time, 1696,

11:13.960 --> 11:25.160
the worth of the English coin was 25% below the worth of silver contained,

11:29.000 --> 11:34.840
that it should have had, as these coins had often been clipped, and were also extremely worn.

11:34.840 --> 11:46.280
The exchange between England and France was said to be 25% against France,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.680
and hence in favour of England.

11:50.679 --> 12:04.919
I like to remember this as: the exchange favours the vendor of actual material goods

12:07.479 --> 12:15.079
if they are to be encouraged by an augmentation in the receipt of a higher amount of silver upon

12:15.080 --> 12:30.840
payment. So, we have that in King William's time, the worth of English coin was 25% below

12:33.400 --> 12:42.280
the worth of freshly minted silver coin; and because of this, the exchange between

12:42.279 --> 12:47.959
England and France was said to be 25% in favour of England.

12:55.079 --> 13:07.639
However, if the payment was made in English coin which was non-clipped, and non-worn,

13:08.199 --> 13:15.720
the French manufacturer who cashed a merchant's bill upon a reputable London merchant, could

13:16.840 --> 13:26.039
then obtain more silver than the calculated amount, i.e. what Smith called the real exchange,

13:26.919 --> 13:32.439
which means the actual amount of pure silver contained within 10 specific coins,

13:32.600 --> 13:44.120
may have been greater than the agreed amount, and hence the French merchant exporting to London,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.920
might get the premium.

13:47.000 --> 14:02.360
If the French merchant could somehow select the better quality, newly freshly minted coin,

14:04.199 --> 14:11.159
which had not been clipped or worn, then the French merchant would obviously obtain

14:11.719 --> 14:17.959
more silver than if the merchant had been paid in old, worn, clipped coin.

14:20.360 --> 14:27.480
The Bank of Amsterdam was a formulation of a banking system for international trade,

14:27.480 --> 14:29.799
which avoided ambiguities and variables.

14:35.879 --> 14:39.159
So, let's now talk about the Bank of Amsterdam.
