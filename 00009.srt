00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
In the following quotation from Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, when the author uses the

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,600
words as "nominal price", he has previously defined this to be the price in money which

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:38,159
is paid. The quotation is taken from book 1, chapter 11, part 3, which is

4
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,320
titled: "Digression concerning the variations in the value of silver

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,600
during the course of the four last centuries." Recall that this book was

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:04,319
published in the 1770s; so, the four last centuries are from 1300 onwards. I

7
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,439
quote: "But the nominal sum which constitutes the market price of every

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:21,879
commodity, is necessarily regulated, not so much by the quantity of silver which

9
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:28,879
according to the standard ought to be contained in it, as by that which it is

10
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:36,680
found by experience actually is contained in it. This nominal sum

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:45,320
therefore is necessarily higher when the coin is much debased by clipping and

12
00:01:45,320 --> 00:02:02,040
wearing, than when near to its standard value." End quote. Smith here is inferring

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:10,640
that when the coin contains less silver than freshly minted silver coin, its

14
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:22,719
worth, and hence Smith's understanding of its cost, is less.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,759
Hence money has now decreased in price.

16
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:39,439
Note that in our previous examples, where we put the commodity under question on

17
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,719
the left side of the see-saw, and then doubled its price, or doubled its cost,

18
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,719
or doubled its worth, that when its price doubled, by the 18th century viewpoint,

19
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:09,560
its cost doubled, and its worth doubled. And when its cost doubled, that is the

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,599
cost of the item on the left-hand side of the see-saw, the ratio of one-to-one was

21
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:23,400
transformed into a ratio of one-to-two: that is, the left-hand side of the see-saw

22
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,879
to the right-hand side of the see-saw.

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,840
In the 18th century viewpoint, when the cost halves, the worth also halves.

24
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:55,120
We can infer that if the cost doubled, the ratio of one-to-one transformed into a

25
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:04,599
ratio of one-to-two, left to right. But what is a ratio? It signifies the amount

26
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:12,439
of something: the quantity of the item to be exchanged.

27
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,879
Where the price doubled, the cost doubled. Where the price doubled, the worth

28
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:34,199
doubled. The cost, and the worth, were equivalent by the 18th century viewpoint.

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:45,320
So, likewise, if the price were to half, the cost would halve, thereby also halving

30
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,520
the worth.

31
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:02,879
Let us say that a bushel of wheat, instead of being paid for in freshly minted

32
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:11,759
coin, is paid for in debased, clipped, worn coin.

33
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:23,159
So, a bushel of wheat now costs more money because you need more of those coins

34
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:32,040
stamped with a specific, clipped, and worn denomination in money, to acquire

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:45,280
a fixed weight of silver. This presumes of course that the ratio between freshly

36
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,240
minted silver coin, and bushels of wheat, remains unaltered.

37
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:06,960
A specific, stamped, denomination of this worn, or clipped, silver coin affords fewer items of

38
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:22,399
bushels of wheat because it will purchase less wheat. Therefore, a bushel of wheat now costs more money.

39
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:34,120
Adam Smith did not think about money, or rationalise its price, and cost, in the same

40
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:43,639
way that a 20th century individual did. The 20th century economist is a 20th

41
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,720
century individual, and may very well believe that if the price of money rises

42
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:03,040
that more money will exchange by a fixed number of bushels of wheat: thus, also

43
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:11,760
believing that if the price of money falls, that less money will exchange by a fixed number of

44
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:34,039
bushels of wheat. The 20th century viewpoint is not that of the 18th century: which is that if the price

45
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:47,600
of money falls, its cost decreases, and hence more money will exchange by the same amount of wheat;

46
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:57,320
so less wheat can be had for the same amount of money.

47
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:23,840
To see this pictorially, imagine a vertical scale consisting of the amount of something.

48
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:40,480
Previously, so much money, the amount of which is fixed, exchanges by the amount as say 10

49
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:54,120
bushels of wheat. After the price of money falls, the amount of money which will exchange by 10

50
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:13,799
bushels of wheat increases. So, the ratio has become altered: more money, a greater amount of it, is

51
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:25,000
required to exchange by 10 bushels of wheat. So, 10 bushels of wheat will exchange by more money:

52
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:40,919
which is the same as saying, that, for a fixed amount of money, fewer bushels of wheat, less than 10,

53
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:51,360
will exchange by this fixed amount of money, after the price of money has fallen.
