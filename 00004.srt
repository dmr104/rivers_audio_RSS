1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,700
I am the harbinger of economic prosperity, Long heft I forebeared, To bring about peace;

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:17,120
and forebode Trust between brethren and kith; Not passage to degeneracy.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,640
I am the architect of a better tomorrow, I can see the past fore-told, To shine upon

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,760
an archaic monolith. Besmote with feelings, kind and old.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,880
I am the wind of fortunes passing, I am the kind of smiling, laughing.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,120
I shall be kind to little old ladies, Telling me stories of ever-so old.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,600
I was not before the arcane angels, I was in better to bring about fortune. I am an

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,240
apple-seed grazing in past-time, Indigo fortune of ever-so old.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:00,000
Ladies and footmen and fortunes and passing, Inter-twine features of pastures and laughing.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,939
I see the angels with myriad faces, Intestine feelings of interlaced spaces. Voters, and

11
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:13,599
coasters, and railway sleepers, Dreary believers of myriad stations.

12
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,520
National heroes and nationalist graces, Are enmity to our saviour-faces.

13
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,879
Are you incumbent upon our noble races?

14
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,199
Are you insiders of indigo spaces?

15
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:36,280
Voters are not avoidant of laughter. Wisdom shall not be banished hereafter.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,239
My insiders are never without though, Eating that apple that I never let grow.

17
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:50,599
Beaten brows and beaten frowns, Shall ne'er let the saviour crown, His horse to be dead of

18
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,959
course, Nor kingdom to be heard of hoarse.

19
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,319
My nonchalance pose and my broken throws, Shall mimic the apes of discourse; and toes To be

20
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,519
upon the party-line, which Shall be towed, like trawlers cold.

21
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,759
I say, what does all this mean?

22
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,159
I say, did Jack eat that bean?

23
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,560
When shall the future be here?

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,120
Whence shall the saviour-face appear?

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,719
Who shall not that very angel be?

26
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,479
Who is alive, and who is free?

27
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,000
Not the craven, nor the dead.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,199
To progress, shall we put our bed: Our homestead raven, our property, Our slaves to freedom,

29
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:41,879
our enmity, To change, the presage of the past; Not futures known, nor even cast.

30
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,119
I am the bard, now follow me. Emancipation. Liberty.

31
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:53,159
The knee shall grow; The slaves are gone. The sun shine forth to evening song.

32
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,599
The mistakes are yet made by man, Who can be blind to his every can. Or can't, not knowing

33
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,359
what to do. If evening comes, I'll be anew, To porridge of the idle soup, Not ever-more

34
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,000
in an awful loop.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,959
Just read. Just let the words ring true. Just be like me. Just see it through!
