Introduction Part 5 The Amazonian Rainforest and the Balance of Trade

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I don't like to point this out to you, but John Maynard Keynes based his ideas upon those

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,960
of an obscure book by Hobson and Mummery,

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:38,080
the ideology of which is to prevent individuals saving capital by taking it off them in taxes

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,840
if they do.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,680
These ideas of political economy are manifest within the tax system of 2024, and have been

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,760
ever since Keynes' diatribe infiltrated the collective consciousness of people who create

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,320
governmental policies about taxation.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:19,200
As a consequence of Keynes, the majority of modern economists have anxious ideas about

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,400
money gravitating towards the location of where stock is.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,440
They call this the "balance of trade":

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,080
how much money leaves the nation through importation to that nation, and how much money enters the

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,680
country through exportation from that country.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:02:03,440
I say these ideas are misfounded, and have caused the destruction of the Amazonian Rainforest.

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:16,400
I paraphrase from Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chapter 2, "Of Restraints upon Importation".

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,520
When the necessaries of life have become taxed in any country, it becomes proper, some

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:35,280
people pretend, to tax not only the like necessaries of life imported from other countries, but

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,080
all sorts of foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,280
produce of domestic industry.

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Subsistence, these people say, becomes necessarily dearer in consequence of such taxes:

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,840
:such taxes as taxes upon domestically produced commodities.

22
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:22,680
"They", in Adam Smith's time, have understood this one correctly.

23
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:40,520
And the price of labour must always rise with the price of the labourer's subsistence.

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,960
Again this statement is true.

25
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Every commodity, therefore, which is the produce of domestic industry, though not immediately

26
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:06,240
taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes, because the labour which produces

27
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,920
it becomes so.

28
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:27,680
True again, though this is really not readily perceived by policy makers today, i.e. as the cost of

29
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:37,440
living rises, so does the cost of labour, because this increase in the cost of living,

30
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:49,120
which is the result of taxes upon produced commodities, has to be passed on to the price

31
00:04:49,120 --> 00:05:01,760
at which all domestically produced commodities are sold.

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,400
Note that domestic labour is required to produce domestically produced commodities.

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Smith was talking about inflation before the word was invented.

34
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,800
In order to put domestic upon the same footing with foreign industry, therefore, it becomes

35
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:40,960
necessary, the misguided people think, to lay some duty, which is a taxation, upon every

36
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:51,080
foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities with

37
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,600
which it can come into competition.

38
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:12,600
i.e. the misguided people have built a monetary house of cards upon the following proposition,

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:22,760
which is: the likes of malt tariffs on domestically produced malt causes inflation, which is bad

40
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,040
for all domestic industry.

41
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,120
So, the misguided people think, to counteract this, the government should increase its revenues

42
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,920
by increasing duties on everything imported from abroad, wine, candles, silk, cotton,

43
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:50,520
silver, etc.  But, in truth, this increases the price of living further, as vineyards

44
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,440
in Scotland are not as favourably climatised as those in France; and so people of Scotland

45
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,800
are prevented from buying French wine, most probably of a superior quality, at its cheaper

46
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
price.

47
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:16,680
When the price of living increases, this has the most visible effect of requiring the government

48
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,560
to pay a higher amount of individual wages to public servants to meet this price of living

49
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:35,160
increase, which requires more revenues, which, if not in the form as PET, personal expenditure

50
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,680
tax, increase the price of living further.

51
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
This is a vicious circle.

52
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,120
Further, individuals can save less when the price of living is higher, resulting in fewer

53
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:09,040
savings, hence less capital gains, hence less money to invest in stock, hence both fewer

54
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,880
people employed by working upon this stock --

55
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,320
this is what unemployment is -- and also as a consequence of this reduction in stock,

56
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:32,160
failure of competition, impaired markets, and larger firms buying out or out-competing

57
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:40,080
smaller enterprises: which is a parody of, and a perversion of, the way the world ought

58
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,400
to be.

59
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,920
In the Victorian era, the poet Stephen Crane wrote,

60
00:08:48,920 --> 00:09:00,440
God fashioned the ship of the world carefully. With the infinite skill of an all-master

61
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Made He the hull and the sails.

62
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Held He the rudder, ready for adjustment.

63
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,960
Erect stood he, scanning his work proudly.

64
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Then -- at fateful time -- a wrong called, and God turned heeding.

65
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:35,640
Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly, Making cunning noiseless travel down

66
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,440
the ways.

67
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:49,400
So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas, Going ridiculous voyages, Making

68
00:09:49,400 --> 00:10:01,000
quaint progress, Turning as with serious purpose, Before stupid winds.

69
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:24,440
And there were many in the sky Who laughed at this thing. I now quote from Wealth of Nations, book 4, chapter 3, part 2.

70
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,840
When two places trade with one another,

71
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:39,720
this doctrine, end quote, of the balance of trade, quote, supposes that, if the balance

72
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:50,880
be even, neither of them loses or gains; but, if it leans in any degree to one side, that

73
00:10:50,880 --> 00:11:00,640
one of them loses and the other gains, in proportion to its declension from the exact

74
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,640
equilibrium.

75
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Both suppositions are false.

76
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:28,560
End quote, I quote, Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of

77
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:38,140
the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other

78
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:46,620
regulations of commerce, are founded.

79
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,780
End quote.

80
00:11:51,780 --> 00:12:01,220
Those restraints being, the extraordinary restraints laid upon the importation of goods

81
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:18,660
from other countries, with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous.

82
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,140
The following is true:

83
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:37,060
I quote, If the balance be even, and if the trade between the two places consist altogether

84
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:48,100
in the exchange of their native commodities, they will, upon most occasions, not only both

85
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:59,940
gain, but they will gain equally or very nearly equally;

86
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:17,020
each will, in this case, afford a market for a part of the surplus produce of the other;

87
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:27,140
each will replace a capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for the

88
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:38,860
market this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been distributed

89
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:55,540
among, and given revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants.

90
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,780
End quote.

91
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:14,740
Recall that capital is material tangible stuff, or, in the form of money, it is the

92
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:33,300
worth of the money, i.e. the amount of material tangible stuff the money will exchange by.

93
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:45,340
Let us just say, 17% of the Scotch production of whisky is exported exclusively to France,

94
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:59,980
which in turn exports 41% of its wine production exclusively to Scotland; and that this 17%

95
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:11,460
of whisky will exchange for the same amount of stuff that 41% of the wine production of

96
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:21,460
France will exchange for.

97
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:31,220
This 17% of the production of Scotch whisky, which is exported from Scotland, does not find

98
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:39,700
a home market within Scotland, because the Scottish population have only a requirement

99
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:50,420
for the purchase and consumption of a finite number of gallons of whisky each year.

100
00:15:50,420 --> 00:16:01,260
This is called the absolute demand:

101
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,820
it is what they would like to have.

102
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,500
They may wish to have no more than this.

103
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,540
If I have six suits in my wardrobe and somebody offers me a high-quality suit on discount,

104
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,980
I may wish to buy it because it is of better quality than my existing suits.

105
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,420
But if the suit on offer is of the same quality, I am likely to say, "Sorry, but I already have

106
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:40,860
six suits, and I have no space for one more.

107
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:48,340
The same is true pertaining to the home market by the consumption of whisky in Scotland,

108
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:57,020
and the home market by the consumption of wine within France.

109
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,300
The home market may require, if it can afford to buy, and assuming it can afford to buy,

110
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:11,860
so much, and no more, whisky, or wine.

111
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:21,220
Obviously, wine is not produced in Scotland due to climate reasons.

112
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:29,020
So it must be imported to Scotland instead.

113
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,740
Without this exchange of actual commodities between France and Scotland, there would be

114
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:45,740
less industry performed in France: less stock upon which the industry is performed, more

115
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:57,500
unemployment, and less gold would be attracted to this non-augmented industry -- where industry

116
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,460
is work, or meaningful labour.

117
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,580
Scottish people, having a demand for wine, would not be able to get hold of it, thus

118
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:25,580
creating a market for, perhaps, smugglers, to smuggle this wine as contraband to Scotland.

119
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:35,500
The French, deprived of their natural liberty, would be unable to acquire Scotch whisky;

120
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,820
and this, in turn, would deprive Scotland from being able to augment its stock in provisions, materials,

121
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:50,460
and finished goods, pertaining to the whisky industry.

122
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:59,620
Thus, their industry would be non-augmented, and money, being less attracted to this non-augmented

123
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:06,900
industry within Scotland, would flow out of Scotland as foreign investments become apparent

124
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:19,580
and more lucrative elsewhere.

125
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:29,100
Let me repeat these last words I quoted from Book 4, Chapter 3, Part 2.

126
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:36,860
Each place will replace a capital which had been employed in raising and preparing for

127
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:44,580
the market this part of the surplus produce of the other, and which had been distributed

128
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:59,060
among, and given revenue and maintenance to, a certain number of its inhabitants.

129
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:10,700
"Given revenue to the wages people in the Scotch whisky industry get paid" affords them

130
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:20,220
clothes, affords them houses, and affords them the ability, or it ought to, to save:

131
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:33,900
to generate their own worth of money which can be used as capital within their own enterprises.

132
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:42,460
I quote, Some part of the inhabitants of each, therefore, will directly derive their

133
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,260
revenue and maintenance from the other.

134
00:20:47,260 --> 00:21:04,380
end quote, i.e. the workers within the Scotch whisky industry will derive their capabilities

135
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:15,180
to acquire the necessaries and luxuries of the price of living by the consumption within

136
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:30,300
France of 17% of the total production of whisky within Scotland.

137
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:43,980
Adam Smith continued, As the commodities exchanged, too, are supposed to be of equal value,

138
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:54,820
so the two capitals employed in the trade will, upon most occasions, be equal, or very

139
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:07,180
nearly equal; and both being employed in raising the native commodities of the two countries,

140
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:15,660
the revenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will

141
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:23,100
be equal, or very nearly equal.

142
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:33,820
This revenue and maintenance, thus mutually afforded, will be greater or smaller, in proportion

143
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:45,420
to the extent of their dealings. If these should annually amount to £100,000, for example,

144
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:57,100
or to £1,000,000, on each side, each of them will afford an annual revenue, in the one case

145
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:08,620
of £100,000, and, in the other, of £1,000,000, to the inhabitants of the other.

146
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:21,340
End quote. As an aside, the expression one millions,

147
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:29,580
where millions is in plural, was the correct way of speaking back then.
