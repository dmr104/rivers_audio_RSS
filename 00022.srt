1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
I would like to end this introductory book, one of a quadrilogy, with the thoughts that

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:32,880
when Julius Caesar took his troops across the river Rubicon, he paused: he paused because he knew he

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:42,320
would change the face of civilization and that the path of history would never be the same after

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:59,280
his actions. At the end of chapter 26 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon wrote,

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:09,040
"Such were the scenes of barbaric rage, which disgraced the palace and table of the Roman

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:20,319
Emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of

7
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:32,639
Theodosius, the public safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single man."

8
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,119
(end quote).

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:59,360
At this moment in time, half of the American voters believe that the economic institutions

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:09,520
which rule them don't function wisely. I concur with this viewpoint.

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,439
It is my policy not to be partisan with politics because I wish to persuade politicians.

12
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:36,800
One thing I am certain though is that the leader who represents these partisan people

13
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:47,120
possibly won't comprehend a word I have said. For a start he won't have time.

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:06,400
It seems that there will be an ideological battle to win hearts and minds within the world,

15
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,520
particularly surrounding issues regarding land utilisation or land ownership.

16
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:31,760
This is a subject I deal with within my first book beyond this introductory book called Extinction

17
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:45,120
Avoidance. On a personal note, I would like to add that I will not be having a career in politics.

18
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,719
I would experience ad hominem attacks which would be counterproductive to the

19
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:03,520
aims and objectives of my message. You will have to do this one without me.

20
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,320
I shall not be your saviour.

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,280
I am not coming to rescue you.

22
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,840
I believe in legal frameworks.

23
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
I believe in impartial institutions.

24
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:45,360
In chapter 58 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon wrote,

25
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:55,839
"Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of feudal tyranny,

26
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:08,000
the institution of cities and corporations is one of the most powerful;

27
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:20,079
and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first crusade,

28
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:30,240
they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world."

29
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:54,400
When Gibbon here uses the word as "corporations", he is referring to the legal system, courts, judgments.

30
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:04,879
Previously, where Adam Smith used the word as "corporations", he was talking about

31
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:13,839
trade guilds which sought to achieve powers of monopoly within trade.

32
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:29,439
To be sure, I say the first crusade was a brutal genocidal act of barbaric warfare.

33
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:43,600
Gibbon is producing evidence about the establishment of bodies which govern,

34
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,839
and saying that those of the region which Jerusalem was part of,

35
00:06:50,479 --> 00:07:02,479
after the first crusade, may be ranked with those of the Byzantine Empire,

36
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:11,599
the Roman Catholic Church, and what legal and judicial bodies were remaining

37
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,920
during and after the decline of the institutions of Western Rome.

38
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:39,120
Within the year 1942, the Beverage report addressed want, disease, ignorance, idleness,

39
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,120
and squalor, as five dragons to be slain.

40
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
Well, the year is now 2024.

41
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,680
The five dragons I would like to propose

42
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:16,879
are: sickness, want, idleness, ill health, and vulnerability.

43
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:29,680
Sickness can be addressed by having a health service which is paid

44
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,639
by taxation in the form of PET.

45
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:47,439
Want can be addressed by

46
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,439
achieving unfettered and unregulated trade,

47
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,759
not by calling regulation freedom.

48
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:19,199
Idleness can be addressed by stock employing people

49
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:30,080
when industry, industrious work, is performed intelligently upon this stock.

50
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:41,360
Ill health is somewhat of an umbrella term.

51
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:53,360
In my opinion, people can be linguistically unhealthy if the speaker and the listener

52
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,519
can't achieve a level of communication.

53
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,680
There are many thoughts, particularly thoughts within economics, which lead to

54
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,639
delusive opinions promulgating across the world.

55
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:31,840
I consider these ideas to be unhealthy because when they are implemented in law

56
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,559
they achieve a sort of prison.

57
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:47,519
People are waiting for the end of the day without doing anything other than going around in circles.

58
00:10:51,039 --> 00:11:01,279
Now the fifth giant to be slain is vulnerability.

59
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,279
When I say this, I mean vulnerability to autocratic dictators

60
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,919
who often have a position of military strength which is greater than that of Western democracies.

61
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:35,120
If Western democracies are to not be vulnerable to invasion then

62
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,600
they need industrial output, armaments, shipping industries, steel industries;

63
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,159
they need to do more than retail;

64
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
they need to do more than provide banking services;

65
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,000
they need to do more than provide hotels by the seaside.

66
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:27,279
I believe it can be achievable but not without addressing concepts such as land utilisation

67
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:39,439
or land ownership because land can't be moved: land is the surface of a sphere.

68
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:51,360
There's only so much of it that can go around and then its price increases indefinitely

69
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
as population and demand for it rises.

70
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,720
Addressing these concepts is an ecological challenge.

71
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,759
The intransigence towards these discussions is the immediate knee-jerk reaction whereby people

72
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,240
say, "Oh, that can't be done because big business has too much invested in land ownership."

73
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
But the Romans had so much invested within slavery.

74
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:39,120
I say that a figure called Jesus was pretty influential in saying revolutionary things

75
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
at the time, such as be nice to people.

76
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:55,600
That Jesus of Nazareth omitted to mention slavery altogether was possibly a masterpiece

77
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,840
of design, a masterpiece of public relations,

78
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:17,759
because Jesus of Nazareth denormalised this behaviour for future generations.

79
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,759
The Quran, in my opinion, was not so far sighted.

80
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:35,840
It dealt with local politics such as who was allowed to pass through Medina, and what to do

81
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,960
if you got attacked.

82
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,200
It dealt with women's rights in response to an experience Mohammed had, a revelation,

83
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,120
after having a discussion about the rights of women, with women.

84
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,920
One of the key messages I got from the Quran is that a prophet is not a deity.

85
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,879
A prophet is not the Almighty.

86
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:22,399
A prophet is a kind of inspired teacher who sees further than somebody else.

87
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:34,399
I believe that the message of the Quran is not to copy Mohammed;

88
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,399
it is not to dress like him;

89
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,399
it is not to emulate him:

90
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:56,159
but to understand the inspired messages that are written within the canon of the Islamic faith,

91
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:06,559
which one of was: isn't it amazing how everything got to be here?

92
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:13,279
Look at the stars; look at the sky; look at the earth.

93
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:31,360
And also another central message I received from this religious text was that it is my purpose

94
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,799
to fulfil whatever destiny I can,

95
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,519
to contribute in a meaningful way to the world around me.

96
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,439
I'm sure that many Christians would agree with this also, as would many of the Judaic faith,

97
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
and other faiths around the world.

98
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:25,440
In Gaza, at the moment, we witness how the leader of an army might regard the whole population as subhuman,

99
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:38,880
simply because a group of people called Hamas, an armed dictatorship that kills dissidents,

100
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,799
has controlled the population and embedded itself among them.

101
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:57,440
And in its turn Hamas views

102
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:07,440
every Jewish person living in Israel as subhuman, to be murdered and enslaved.

103
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,200
But this situation arose out of a concept called land ownership.

104
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:35,440
And land ownership is a theme I will deal with in my first book called Extinction Avoidance.

105
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:48,320
As a final criticism of the current leader of the military

106
00:18:50,160 --> 00:19:00,000
that evidence indicates has committed war crimes within the Gaza Strip against a civilian population,

107
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:18,000
I should add the Jewish canon specifies that not more than one eye should be taken as revenge

108
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
for one eye:

109
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:36,240
that retribution should be limited in scope to that which has been inflicted upon the initial victim.

110
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:50,559
I believe that the numbers of civilian casualties, the lack of water, the lack of food,

111
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:59,359
the lack of shelter, and the sheer economic damage that is happening in the region

112
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:09,519
might be considered to constitute more than one eye for one eye.

113
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:27,359
This is the end of this introductory book entitled Rivers of imprisonment.

114
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,359
The end.
