00:00.000 --> 00:13.599
This bank was established in 1609, under what Smith called "the guarantee of the city",

00:13.599 --> 00:20.559
under the supervision, and direction, of 4 Burgomasters, who were trustworthy respectable

00:20.559 --> 00:28.879
individuals from the city; and each directing Burgomaster, all 4 of them, are changed each year.

00:31.919 --> 00:38.079
Each new set of Burgomasters counts the gold in the bank, compares it with the books the bank

00:38.079 --> 00:44.320
is keeping, and delivers the bank's books, and reserve of gold and silver, to the new set of

00:44.399 --> 00:47.119
Burgomasters, who receive the same upon oath.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.840
Smith said, "...in that sober and religious country, oaths are not yet disregarded."

01:02.400 --> 01:09.760
Smith also said, "Amidst all the revolutions which faction has ever occasioned in the

01:09.760 --> 01:17.520
government of Amsterdam, the prevailing party has at no time accused their predecessors of

01:17.520 --> 01:27.040
infidelity in the administration of the bank. No accusation could have affected more deeply

01:27.040 --> 01:35.280
the reputation and fortune of the disgraced party; and if such an accusation could have been supported,

01:36.239 --> 01:42.079
we may be assured that it would have been brought." (End quotation).

01:46.079 --> 01:53.280
When money, in either coin, or bullion, was deposited with the bank, the bank would give

01:53.280 --> 01:59.359
credit in its books, typically 5% below the market price of bullion.

01:59.920 --> 02:07.840
This 5% was called the agio. What does this mean?

02:10.479 --> 02:15.680
Recall from our previous discussion about apples being directly bartered for money,

02:17.759 --> 02:23.199
that if the price of apples doubles, but the price of money remains the same,

02:24.000 --> 02:29.359
then twice as much money can be had for the same amount of apples:

02:32.000 --> 02:42.959
which is the same thing as saying that half as many apples will exchange by the same amount of money than before.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.759
The credit the bank gives in its books

02:53.199 --> 02:58.479
is known as the bank price of bullion:

03:02.560 --> 03:10.719
it is typically 5% below the market price of bullion. This is known as the agio.

03:11.039 --> 03:23.520
If, however, the money deposited toward the bank was in the form of clipped, and worn, coin,

03:23.520 --> 03:30.560
which is diminished currency, from the neighbouring states, then in the example of the bank of

03:30.560 --> 03:39.360
Hamburg, not Amsterdam, the supposed difference between the old, clipped, worn, coins, (quote) "poured

03:39.360 --> 03:45.840
into it from all the neighbouring states" (end quote), and the new, freshly minted, currency,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.800
of the state of Hamburg, was 14%.

03:56.080 --> 04:01.600
That is, the worth, or the cost, of the newly minted coin, was 14%

04:02.319 --> 04:10.319
above the worth of the old worn, clipped, and debased, coin, from other nations.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.439
That is to say, the price of the new freshly minted coin of Hamburg, the state of Hamburg,

04:24.399 --> 04:35.519
to which the city of Hamburg belonged, was 14% higher than that of the price of the old,

04:36.560 --> 04:43.279
debased, worn, clipped, coin, which was flooding in to the city of Hamburg from the surrounding states.

04:45.199 --> 04:50.240
What was of value was the estimated amount of gold and silver contained therein.

04:53.600 --> 05:04.240
Here, Smith makes no mention of the bank of Hamburg issuing bank money as credits upon anybody's

05:04.240 --> 05:09.759
account; so I presume that this service was not offered by the bank of Hamburg.

05:09.920 --> 05:26.399
To illustrate this diagrammatically further, let us say that 50 pounds worth of clipped coin would

05:26.399 --> 05:38.079
exchange for 100 bushels of wheat. Then, we would say that the price of the clipped coin was lower

05:38.079 --> 05:49.199
than that of the freshly minted coin, because only 43 pounds of the freshly minted coin would exchange

05:49.199 --> 05:59.360
for 100 bushels of wheat. Thus, that which has a higher price, i.e. the freshly minted coin,

05:59.360 --> 06:04.959
would be of a lesser amount when the bushels of wheat were fixed in amount.

06:08.879 --> 06:17.519
That which had a lower price, such as the clipped coin, would exchange in a greater amount for 100

06:17.519 --> 06:27.279
bushels of wheat. Here I have used a difference between the price in money of the clipped coin,

06:27.279 --> 06:31.759
and the price in money of the freshly minted coin as 14%.

06:32.639 --> 06:45.439
Recall that the words as "price", "worth" and "cost" can be used interchangeably, within the 18th century.

06:50.879 --> 06:58.000
I now must tell you of a profitable ruse which Smith warns us operated in England.

06:58.000 --> 07:10.079
The seignorage is the price paid for the cost of minting any form of gold into golden sovereigns.

07:11.920 --> 07:18.399
Initially, the old coin, or bullion which may have been of doubtful purity and authenticity,

07:18.560 --> 07:26.399
or, gold plate, cups, trophies, jewellery, etc. was melted.

07:30.319 --> 07:35.039
This allowed the separation of the gold from the other metals it was mixed with.

07:37.679 --> 07:44.959
Then, the Royal Mint would mix the gold with the other metals in the correct proportions

07:45.439 --> 07:52.319
for the composition of a gold sovereign, which would be formed.

07:54.879 --> 07:59.759
The cost of this work, the seignorage, was paid for by the English crown,

08:00.959 --> 08:07.279
i.e. the revenues received by the state, by taxation: such as malt duties,

08:08.719 --> 08:12.319
and taxes imposed upon the importation of goods, etc.

08:12.319 --> 08:27.040
The idea was to distribute, and freely intermingle, these new coins, with the older ones.

08:28.879 --> 08:32.480
But, there was no realistic way to collect, and filter out, all the older ones.

08:34.240 --> 08:39.120
In fact, there was a profitable reason why the newer ones were filtered out and removed from

08:39.120 --> 08:48.799
circulation; and this reason was that if Mr Joe Bloggs could get in his hand a large number of these

08:49.360 --> 08:55.440
new, freshly minted, coins, he could melt them down into bullion, and then take that bullion

08:55.440 --> 09:03.519
to the Royal Mint, to be re-minted into new, freshly minted, coin. This happened because the Royal Mint

09:03.519 --> 09:21.439
bought at the price of the old, worn, clipped, coin, which was priced at, say, 9% lower than the new,

09:21.439 --> 09:30.000
freshly, minted coin, from the Royal Mint. So long as the market price of gold bullion

09:30.000 --> 09:36.480
was less than the mint price of the new coin, the person committing this ruse

09:36.480 --> 09:41.679
would be buying low, and selling high: thus making a profit.

09:46.159 --> 09:56.480
To explain this further, let the weight of pure gold be one ounce in weight within

09:57.039 --> 10:05.360
freshly minted coin from the mint, and say this gold has been stamped with a denomination of

10:05.360 --> 10:20.000
46 pounds 72 and a half pence. Mr Joe Bloggs can now melt this down, into, say, bullion which is worth

10:20.000 --> 10:31.200
48 pounds, and sell this to the mint for 48 pounds, which is the price at which the mint

10:31.200 --> 10:39.279
buys bullion, in order to create the denominated value of 46 pounds 72 and a half pence of freshly

10:39.279 --> 10:52.959
minted coin. That one ounce in weight of gold has the worth of, say, 1000 bushels of wheat.

10:52.959 --> 11:02.159
He would be selling it for the worth of, say, 1026 bushels of wheat, and pocketing the difference.

11:02.799 --> 11:13.360
That is to say, he receives his one ounce in pure gold, in the form of a denomination

11:13.360 --> 11:25.679
of 46 pounds and 72 pence; but after he has melted this into plate, jewellery, or bullion, he can sell it

11:25.679 --> 11:42.079
for 48 pounds. The Royal Mint will issue 46 pounds 72 and a half pence of denominated value

11:42.799 --> 11:48.159
for every 50 pounds of old clipped and worn denominated value it receives.

11:48.159 --> 11:59.439
This is what the Royal Mint is attempting to do. The Royal Mint also buys in bullion,

12:00.240 --> 12:13.600
plate, and jewellery, and melts that down. Mr Joe Bloggs would, in effect, be buying a

12:13.600 --> 12:19.840
certain amount of gold at a lower price, and selling it at a higher price.

12:28.720 --> 12:41.040
The denominated worth of the received, newly freshly minted coin, would be lower than the worth of the gold

12:41.039 --> 12:52.480
bullion which was brought to the Mint; and by melting down the new freshly minted coin into

12:52.480 --> 13:08.480
bullion, a profit could be realistically made. You should know that 46 pounds : 14 :

13:08.480 --> 13:23.920
6, signifies the stamped denomination as 46 pounds, 14 shillings, and 6 pence, where 20 shillings equal

13:23.919 --> 13:39.360
one pound, and 12 d (12 pence) equal one shilling. 46 pounds, 14 shillings, and 6 pence, of new, freshly

13:39.360 --> 13:54.240
minted coin, would contain the same amount of silver as 50 pounds of old clipped worn coin.

13:56.159 --> 13:59.519
The difference being approximately 8% in this case.

14:00.399 --> 14:09.919
At the same time, the market price of silver bullion would vary between

14:12.240 --> 14:19.039
47 pounds, 14 shillings, and 48 pounds.

14:20.000 --> 14:34.559
So, the trickster would be buying an amount of silver at a low price, 46 pounds, 14 shillings,

14:34.559 --> 14:45.279
and 6 pence, and selling it for a higher price, between 47 pounds, 14 shillings, and 48 pounds;

14:45.279 --> 14:56.319
thus making a profit. I quote from book 4 chapter 6 entitled Of Treaties of Commerce.

14:58.639 --> 15:05.360
"The operations of the Mint were, upon this account, somewhat like the web of Penelope;

15:07.519 --> 15:11.360
the work that was done in the day was undone in the night.

15:11.360 --> 15:18.879
The mint was employed, not so much in making daily additions to the coin,

15:20.960 --> 15:25.919
as in replacing the very best part of it, which was daily melted down."

15:25.919 --> 15:29.039
(End quote).

15:36.639 --> 15:42.719
Even if the seignorage was paid by the private individual who brought the gold to the Mint

15:42.719 --> 15:49.279
to be coined, as happened in France, this ruse might still be possible if the

15:49.279 --> 15:58.079
Mint price of the fresh coin would be higher than the market price of bullion:

16:00.480 --> 16:03.439
sufficiently so to take into account the seignorage.

16:05.519 --> 16:13.759
Imagine the difference between 46 pounds, 14 shillings, 6 pence, and 48 pounds, being the cost of

16:13.759 --> 16:22.480
the seignorage. Thus, if the new freshly minted coin becomes melted into ingots, and returned to

16:22.480 --> 16:27.439
the French Mint, this would no longer be profitable for our trickster to do so.

16:33.039 --> 16:40.480
Smith again. "The seignorage will in many cases take away altogether,

16:40.480 --> 16:47.279
and it will in all cases diminish the profit of melting down the new coin.".

16:52.480 --> 16:58.480
But if the seignorage was too great, there lay an alternative peril, which was that of counterfeit

16:58.480 --> 17:07.120
money, i.e. a fraudster money-counterfeiter would construct a coin which looked like a gold sovereign,

17:07.119 --> 17:13.759
and would pass for one in circulation, but which contained far less gold than a genuine one from

17:13.759 --> 17:24.319
the Royal Mint. It is possible, and likely in my view, though Smith does not mention this,

17:25.039 --> 17:33.119
that, when fresh newly minted Dutch coin was minted from old, devalued, clipped, worn coin, from

17:33.119 --> 17:41.839
all states, all places, all nations, that the bank had exclusive access towards obtaining this

17:43.599 --> 17:49.919
(quote) "good and true money" (end quote). I say this because of the following quotation

17:51.119 --> 17:56.559
from Wealth of Nations, book four, chapter three, part one, Digression:

17:57.200 --> 18:08.000
"As a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market than one of our common worn shillings,

18:10.480 --> 18:19.599
so the good and true money which might be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private

18:19.599 --> 18:28.000
person, being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the country, would be of no

18:28.000 --> 18:34.639
more value than that currency, from which it could no longer be readily distinguished.

18:37.679 --> 18:43.199
While it remained in the coffers of the bank, its superiority was known and ascertained.

18:43.600 --> 18:53.680
When it had come into those of a private person, its superiority could not well be ascertained

18:53.680 --> 18:56.880
without more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth.

19:00.880 --> 19:10.880
By being brought from the coffers of the bank, besides, it lost all the other advantages of bank

19:10.880 --> 19:21.760
money; its security, its ease and safe transferability, its use in paying foreign bills of exchange."

19:25.520 --> 19:35.760
(end quote). In the following quotation from the same section, when Smith refers to "this bank",

19:35.759 --> 19:42.000
he is referring to the bank of Amsterdam established in 1609, not the bank of Hamburg.

19:43.920 --> 19:51.920
(start quote) "This bank received both foreign coin, and the light worn coin of the country,

19:52.960 --> 19:58.480
at its real intrinsic value in the good standard money of the country,

19:58.480 --> 20:07.759
deducting only so much as was necessary for defraying the expense of coinage

20:08.640 --> 20:13.839
and the other necessary expense of management." (end quote).

20:16.799 --> 20:27.039
When Smith says the words as "real intrinsic value", he infers that which the amount of gold

20:27.039 --> 20:39.119
contained therein, will exchange for. So, this is our concept as "cost", and also our concept as

20:39.119 --> 20:47.200
"worth", from the 18th century. I'm sorry to have used the word "value" without defining it yet; but

20:47.200 --> 21:03.840
I will do in due course. Treat this as a spoiler. When Smith says (quote) "good standard money of the

21:03.840 --> 21:12.880
country" (end quote), he is referring to the fresh (quote) "good" (end quote), coin which is minted from

21:12.880 --> 21:22.560
this gold by the Dutch Mint, and is of a weight and purity guaranteed by the state which Amsterdam

21:22.560 --> 21:36.080
is part of. The word as "defray" means to pay, or to cover the costs of. Smith continues: (quote)

21:36.079 --> 21:46.559
"For the value which remained after this small deduction was made, it gave a credit in its books.

21:51.199 --> 21:58.000
This credit was called bank money, which, as it represented money exactly according to the standard

21:58.000 --> 22:10.400
of the mint, was always of the same real value, and intrinsically worth more than current money." (end quote)

22:10.400 --> 22:26.560
The bank was not intended to be an institution which makes too much profit.

22:27.600 --> 22:35.120
It charges for its administration costs, and the cost of storing the gold which is brought to it.

22:40.800 --> 22:48.560
We are told that the (quote) "worth" (end quote) of bank money was (quote) "intrinsically

22:49.600 --> 23:05.120
worth more than current money" (end quote), i.e. worth more than the (quote) "light and worn coin of the

23:05.119 --> 23:22.000
country" (end quote). In the same section I quote: "It was at the same time enacted, that all bills drawn

23:22.000 --> 23:29.839
upon or negotiated at Amsterdam, of the value of 600 guilders and upwards, should be paid in bank money,

23:30.639 --> 23:34.639
which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of those bills.

23:36.959 --> 23:44.480
Every merchant, in consequence of this regulation, was obliged to keep an account with the bank,

23:45.039 --> 23:50.879
in order to pay his foreign bills of exchange, which necessarily occasioned a certain demand for bank

23:50.880 --> 23:53.920
money." (end quote)
