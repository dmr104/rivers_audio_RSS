00:00.000 --> 00:17.280
Recall that the circulating capital of a society is composed of four parts, one provisions,

00:17.280 --> 00:27.719
two materials, three finished work, and four money.

00:27.719 --> 00:41.239
The first three: provisions, materials, and finished work, constitute consumable goods.

00:41.239 --> 00:52.200
And whatever portion of consumable goods is not employed in maintaining the fixed capital

00:52.200 --> 01:12.320
of a society, makes part of the neat revenue of the society: which is the stock of that

01:12.319 --> 01:27.839
society which is reserved for immediate consumption. That is the viewpoint as taken by the point of

01:27.840 --> 01:43.719
the view of society as a whole within a nation. Now I would like to talk about the circulating

01:43.719 --> 02:03.640
capital within any given enterprise. I will cite two examples: one involving hammers, and the second

02:03.640 --> 02:16.920
example will involve timber being purchased by a house builder. In the former case, the hammers are

02:16.920 --> 02:29.000
purchased by a type of enterprise which hammers small amounts of gold into gold leaf sheets of gold.

02:29.000 --> 02:42.639
Here the hammers form part of the provisions of that particular enterprise which hammers these

02:42.639 --> 02:58.199
items of gold into thin gold leaf. Within the second example, the timber purchased by the house

02:58.199 --> 03:12.039
builder from the timber merchant, constitutes part of the materials which he requires to build the

03:12.039 --> 03:27.840
finished product. So, in the former case, the item purchased becomes part of the provisions; and in

03:27.840 --> 03:38.799
the latter case, the item purchased becomes part of the materials. Recall that circulating capital

03:38.800 --> 03:50.840
comprises provisions, materials, finished goods, and money. Recall also that when calculating the

03:50.840 --> 04:05.280
neat revenue we must only consider provisions, materials and finished goods, not money. We previously

04:05.280 --> 04:16.279
defined the neat revenue to be the stock reserved for immediate consumption. But I would like to query

04:16.279 --> 04:29.360
at what point the hammer becomes consumed. Is it at the point where it leaves the stock of finished

04:29.960 --> 04:43.920
products at the hammer manufacture's location? Note that the enterprise which hammers gold leaf

04:43.920 --> 04:59.439
does not consume, as part of its immediate consumption, the hammers, because these form part of the required

04:59.439 --> 05:15.000
provisions which are necessary in order to perform this enterprise. The merchant does not consume his

05:15.000 --> 05:28.600
stock because that would be bad accountancy. His circulating capital (quote) "...is totally excluded

05:28.600 --> 05:41.960
from making any part of his neat revenue, which must consist altogether in his profits." (end quote).

05:41.959 --> 06:07.560
This means that out of his profits -- from his profits -- he acquires the component part of money which is to

06:07.560 --> 06:24.680
be used for his immediate consumption. The hammers which ultimately formed part of the provisions of

06:25.439 --> 06:41.160
the enterprise which hammered gold into gold leaf, did actually form part of the neat revenue of the society

06:41.160 --> 06:57.720
to which the enterprise which manufactures hammers belongs. Although these hammers, when regarded as

06:58.360 --> 07:15.000
part of the neat revenue of a society, become not consumed actually by the stock of any individual or

07:15.000 --> 07:26.520
enterprise which is reserved for immediate consumption, they do become consumed in a sense, and so in this

07:26.519 --> 07:38.279
regard, the neat revenue does comprehend the stock reserved for immediate consumption; but it also

07:38.439 --> 07:52.439
comprehends provisions and materials as part of some further enterprise. This is the case when

07:52.519 --> 08:08.839
regarded as the neat revenue of a society: but not as the neat revenue of an individual or an enterprise.

08:09.560 --> 08:23.079
To cite the example of the house builder garnering timber from the timber merchant,

08:26.439 --> 08:35.879
the house builder does not put the timber into his stock reserved for immediate consumption

08:36.120 --> 08:49.639
because he does not consume this himself, and that would be incorrect accountancy anyway.

08:53.480 --> 09:01.000
This timber does form part of the materials required to construct a house,

09:01.720 --> 09:09.720
so we may say that the timber

09:12.759 --> 09:25.720
forms part of the neat revenue of a society, but not that of the enterprise as this house builder.

09:26.680 --> 09:40.920
Does a house become consumed when it is bought? Well in a way, yes; and in a way, no.

09:42.920 --> 09:52.440
The house is an asset which if left uncared for will fall into dilapidation over time.

09:56.680 --> 10:03.240
So, a house is an asset which degrades over time;

10:07.080 --> 10:13.320
and so, in this sense, a house is a consumable commodity.

10:13.320 --> 10:27.800
A punnet of strawberries is also a consumable commodity, which degrades pretty quickly:

10:29.480 --> 10:31.560
a lot more quickly than a house does so.

10:31.639 --> 10:44.359
So, a house is a much better asset than a lot of strawberries

10:45.799 --> 10:52.519
because it retains its value, its worth -- its cost --

10:55.159 --> 10:58.199
for much longer than the strawberries will.

11:02.119 --> 11:07.479
So, a house can also be treated as an asset.

11:11.159 --> 11:14.599
If I am in the strawberry merchant business,

11:17.479 --> 11:24.199
strawberries, which I purchase as my materials for trade, are also an asset;

11:25.160 --> 11:30.840
but these strawberries will perish

11:32.440 --> 11:41.560
quite quickly. Unless I sell them on soon, I won't be able to recover my investment.

11:42.439 --> 11:56.039
Though the timber in the timber-merchant's enterprise must by no means be placed within

11:57.399 --> 12:02.919
the stock of the timber-merchant's which is reserved for his immediate consumption,

12:03.879 --> 12:07.000
this timber

12:10.919 --> 12:16.759
may be consumed by home buyers

12:17.080 --> 12:28.759
whom replace the value of the timber to the timber merchant

12:29.559 --> 12:39.000
together with profits upon this timber; and these home-buyers obtain

12:39.399 --> 12:51.080
this acquisition from a revenue derived from other funds, such as their wages,

12:52.440 --> 12:55.240
or the profits of their own enterprises:

12:59.159 --> 13:06.519
and this replacing to the timber of the timber merchant

13:06.919 --> 13:15.159
does not occasion any diminution either in the capital of the timber merchant,

13:18.519 --> 13:22.840
nor the capital of the home buyer.

13:27.480 --> 13:33.399
The reason why the capital of the home buyer is not decreased,

13:34.039 --> 13:44.199
is because the house is being paid for out of profits of the home-buyer's enterprise,

13:45.799 --> 13:48.759
or the home buyers wages.

13:48.759 --> 14:00.039
Money itself is an asset as a form of capital,

14:01.240 --> 14:10.360
but it does not constitute capital revenue because capital revenue must be material tangible stuff:

14:10.360 --> 14:17.559
such as the materials to work upon, or the finished products, or the fuel which is provided to the factory.

14:19.080 --> 14:28.919
This is another revelation -- or should we say "heresy"?

14:37.879 --> 14:45.159
I shall say that fixed capital, such as a factory owner's machinery,

14:45.879 --> 14:56.120
is part of the set of provisions which this factory owner requires,

14:59.879 --> 15:07.159
and in that sense these assets are part of the circulating capital.

15:08.039 --> 15:21.719
Recall that circulating capital consists of: provisions, materials, finished goods, and money.

15:26.039 --> 15:32.839
The reason why I include fixed capital, such as machinery, within

15:33.639 --> 15:40.920
the provisions of the enterprise which the factory owner owns, is because

15:43.240 --> 15:52.440
he might need to be provided with machinery which he pays for

15:55.960 --> 15:59.560
out of his profits.

16:03.720 --> 16:11.160
Recall that his profits may be spent upon maintaining his fixed capital,

16:12.280 --> 16:17.560
such as maintaining his existing machinery or factory buildings,

16:20.600 --> 16:29.080
or, in the alternative, his profits may be funnelled into his neat revenue:

16:29.800 --> 16:33.480
which is his stock reserved for immediate consumption,

16:36.280 --> 16:38.520
which is not part of the

16:41.960 --> 16:47.639
provisions, materials, and finished products, of his enterprise.

16:48.039 --> 16:56.279
When I say "his stock reserved for immediate consumption",

16:57.319 --> 17:04.279
I mean: that which he purchases by using his neat revenue

17:07.240 --> 17:16.200
in order to use these items himself, or give them to his friends.

17:17.960 --> 17:31.080
Now, after he has built his factory and furnished it with productive machinery,

17:33.160 --> 17:42.840
neither his factory nor his machinery constitutes part of the gross revenue

17:43.399 --> 17:47.559
of his enterprise.

17:52.279 --> 18:01.399
This is because his gross revenue consists of that part of his provisions, materials,

18:02.119 --> 18:09.480
and finished products, which are within flux: which are being exchanged.

18:09.799 --> 18:15.799
He is keeping his factory. He is keeping his machinery.

18:16.920 --> 18:22.759
He is not selling it on like a merchant of machinery would sell the machinery.

18:23.559 --> 18:30.039
He is not in the business of constructing factories to sell them to other entrepreneurs.

18:30.440 --> 18:39.559
He has acquired the assets as his factory and his machinery for the purpose of their use.

18:42.839 --> 18:47.240
So it is what his machinery does,

18:49.159 --> 18:56.200
and the actions which his labourers perform, which changes the materials

18:56.200 --> 19:04.120
into the finished product, and of course he has to pay for the provisions as fuel and water

19:04.120 --> 19:06.519
for his factory to function.

19:11.720 --> 19:19.799
He also has to pay for the materials which his factory works upon, in order to create the finished

19:19.799 --> 19:32.440
product. Fuel is provisions: and provisions in this sense -- the circulatory sense -- is part of his

19:34.119 --> 19:39.559
circulating capital. His provisions in the fixed sense,

19:42.279 --> 19:46.200
although part of his provisions, aren't circulating;

19:46.680 --> 19:55.559
so these provisions such as machinery, and factories -- the buildings of --

20:00.759 --> 20:02.200
are only paid for once,

20:04.920 --> 20:10.279
and then exist as capital -- fixed capital -- assets.

20:10.599 --> 20:26.440
But, the manufacturer of the machinery did sell his machinery when the factory owner bought it;

20:30.200 --> 20:39.639
and so, in a sense, his machinery did become consumed when it became part of the provisions --

20:40.279 --> 20:46.039
part of the fixed capital provisions -- of that factory owner.

20:51.079 --> 20:51.319
So,

20:54.680 --> 20:57.960
when the factory owner acquired these machinery,

20:58.840 --> 21:09.960
this consumption did form part of the neat revenue of a society;

21:13.160 --> 21:17.160
it didn't form part of the neat revenue of the factory owner.

21:17.160 --> 21:31.880
The neat revenue of the factory owner was that part of his profits

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
which he spent upon stock reserved for his immediate consumption.

21:37.240 --> 21:44.839
Here, the factory --

21:46.839 --> 21:53.640
like a house -- is an asset, which is owned by the factory owner.

21:53.880 --> 22:07.160
The factory, indeed, could be sold to another entrepreneur,

22:08.840 --> 22:19.880
and in this sense, the factory itself constitutes part of the neat revenue of a society.

22:24.440 --> 22:32.680
My definition of neat revenue of a society

22:34.759 --> 22:42.040
is, "That part of revenue -- where revenue is tangible material stuff --

22:43.000 --> 22:56.519
that people within that society have at their disposal to acquire as stock reserved for their

22:56.519 --> 23:02.920
immediate consumption." Basically, how wealthy they are.

23:03.880 --> 23:11.400
My definition of gross revenue

23:15.880 --> 23:16.840
encompasses

23:20.920 --> 23:23.000
all the circulating capital,

23:23.720 --> 23:31.960
all the investment in fixed capital,

23:34.839 --> 23:40.839
and all the neat revenue of all people within that society.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.959
I concur with Smith when he says,

23:52.119 --> 24:03.319
"...so money, by means of which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among

24:03.319 --> 24:10.279
all its different members, makes itself no part of that revenue."

24:16.759 --> 24:25.319
This was the heresy I referred to earlier.

24:26.119 --> 24:37.960
Smith said, "Money, therefore, the great wheel of circulation,

24:40.200 --> 24:42.439
the great instrument of commerce,

24:45.720 --> 24:51.639
like all other instruments of trade, though it makes a part,

24:51.960 --> 25:06.040
and a very valuable part, of the capital, makes no part of the revenue of the society to which it belongs;

25:09.080 --> 25:18.360
and though the metal pieces of which it is composed, in the course of their annual circulation,

25:18.679 --> 25:26.039
distribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him,

25:27.959 --> 25:32.439
they make themselves no part of that revenue."
