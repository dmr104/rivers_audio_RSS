1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,599
Here follows a survey of 8 peoples' ideas about the relationship between taxation and

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,480
inflation.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:26,400
Toward the following 8 people, Lewis, Alwyn, Carol, Lee, Rob, Dennis, Murry, and Sam, the

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,759
following 4 questions were asked, to which they responded according to their own insights,

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,280
beliefs and viewpoints pertaining to the subject of economic theory.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,839
Question 1.

7
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:48,280
Is tax a force which reacts to inflation?

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,079
Question 2.

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,359
Does taxation cause inflation?

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,960
Question 3.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:09,039
Does competition, e.g. Apple vs. Samsung, cause inflation?

12
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,840
Question 4.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,719
Does the dynamic changes in the prices of goods, materials, production and transportation

14
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,879
cause inflation as a one-way process?

15
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:36,719
i.e. is it possible that the reverse, deflation, can ever happen because of these things?

16
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:44,919
I collate their answers in the form of yes and no in a table.

17
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:51,079
Where the answer is don't know or maybe or uncertain, I have indicated this with a question

18
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,879
mark.

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:59,319
Where the answer is not recorded, I have indicated this with a hyphen.

20
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,479
For question 1,

21
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:08,759
which was, is tax a force which reacts to inflation(?),

22
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:16,519
all of the participants, bar 2, said yes.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Alwin didn't know; and Sam said yes and no, it depends.

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Lewis said the higher inflation is, the higher the price is, so government receives more

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,360
revenue in tax.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Alwyn said she doesn't know if inflation leads to a change in the rate of taxation,

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,560
or in the amount of revenue the government receives in tax.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,120
Carol said inflation leads to the government adding more taxes.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,680
Lee said inflation causes taxation which is different in each country.

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,159
Rob said yes, tax is a reactive force:

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,080
as the price of goods, materials, production, transportation costs, etc. changes dynamically,

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,400
these changes lead to responsive changes in tax.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,879
If the prices of goods, transport, etc. stay the same, then the rate of taxation is not

34
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:51,560
altered by the government; it remains the same.

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:04:00,599
Dennis said the way taxation reacts to inflation is not direct:

36
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:11,280
the idea of setting the rate of taxes is to encourage or discourage general spending.

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:25,159
He says taxation and inflation are always related; so yes, inflation causes taxation.

38
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Murry said yes, you can try to ease inflation by increasing taxes:

39
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,720
the theory is by taking money out of peoples' pockets they spend less money, meaning that

40
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,800
fewer things are being bought, so prices will come down, which in turn entices people to

41
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,040
purchase.

42
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,520
Murry said tax receipts will increase with inflation;

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,720
governments may reduce tax in times of inflation to prevent destitution;

44
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:16,280
if tax increases, Murry said demand decreases, leading to a slowing of inflation.

45
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Sam's answer to the question, is tax a force which reacts to inflation(?) was, it depends.

46
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,480
Yes and no, he says.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,199
He explains his reasoning in his answer to question 2.

48
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,399
Question 2 was: does taxation cause inflation?

49
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:49,840
The respondees answered this question in a way which disagreed with each other.

50
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:59,039
Lewis says yes, taxation causes inflation. Alwyn says yes, Carol says yes.

51
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,239
Initially Lee didn't know, but upon consideration he concluded yes.

52
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:16,839
Rob says no, taxation does not cause inflation. Dennis says no. Murray says yes; and Sam says

53
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,319
no.

54
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,120
Lewis's reasoning was: he doesn't know if tax causes inflation, but probably yes;

55
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,399
it puts the prices of goods higher because of the tax, and this is to give the government

56
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,599
more revenue.

57
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Alwyn stated taxation causes inflation. Carol says it's supposed not to, but it does.

58
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:01,439
Lee's final answer was tax causes inflation: this is an open question; there are lots of

59
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,800
influences and factors.

60
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,960
Rob says quite categorically that taxation does not cause inflation.

61
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,680
He says that tax is a reactive force, not an inflationary force.

62
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,040
Rob says that inflation is a force which is caused by competition.

63
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Dennis says taxation does not directly cause inflation.

64
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,400
Murry says it can do, yes.

65
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
He says as an aside, interest rates cause inflation.

66
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,120
He says that quantitative easing is a way of printing money, and it will take 30 or 40

67
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:06,360
years to pay for the quantitative easing which happened following the bank collapse of 2008.

68
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,240
Sam's more circumspect answers are: take the national deficit to be the excess of government

69
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,120
spending above the revenue received from taxation.

70
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,759
If taxation increases and government spending remains the same, then this has the effect

71
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:38,960
of reducing the deficit, thereby reducing government borrowing or increasing the national surplus --

72
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:46,159
where national surplus is the excess of government revenue above taxation.

73
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:57,000
Sam says, as demand remains the same, prices will stay the same, thus inflation won't increase.

74
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,319
But, if taxation increases too much, people will have less money to afford to buy things,

75
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:16,360
so demand will fall, leading to a fall in prices, i.e. deflation, or a decrease in inflation.

76
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:25,160
He says, if the government borrows more in order to spend, then this does cause inflation, because

77
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:35,839
demand will increase, leading to an increase in prices, thereby increasing inflation.

78
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:44,240
He says, if taxation falls, but spending remains the same, then the national deficit will become

79
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:53,279
increased, or the national surplus will become reduced.

80
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:01,199
He says, people will have, in this case, more money, elevating prices, which is inflationary.

81
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:08,519
But, if taxation falls, but government spending remains the same, this will increase the amount

82
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,159
of money people have to spend, elevating prices, which is inflationary, unless sufficient growth

83
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,120
happens to absorb this change.

84
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Question 3 was: does competition cause inflation?

85
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Our respondees answered as follows.

86
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Lewis says yes.

87
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,240
Alwyn yes.

88
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,799
Carol yes.

89
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,560
Lee, yes and no.

90
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,039
Rob yes.

91
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,399
Dennis no.

92
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,319
Murry yes and no.

93
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:56,519
Sam says no.

94
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,919
Lewis says yes:

95
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,759
competition causes inflation;

96
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:09,439
and his reasoning was, the more that manufacturers compete with each other, the more that they

97
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,640
produce, and in turn the more that they produce, the higher their costs are, and so in turn

98
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,400
they will charge more for their goods.

99
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,440
Alwyn who said yes:

100
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,920
competition does cause inflation; because when manufacturers compete with each other they

101
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,360
are putting up prices all the time.

102
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,320
She says, the best products are always sold for the highest prices.

103
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,159
Carol said yes.

104
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,720
I have not recorded an explanation.

105
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,759
Lee says yes and no.

106
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:07,920
He says that competition causes inflation, but the opposite can also happen;

107
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:17,799
but essentially the dynamic change of everything other than tax, causes inflation.

108
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,240
That was the viewpoint of Lee.

109
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,199
Rob says yes:

110
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,679
competition causes inflation.

111
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,279
He said the inflationary force is caused by competition.

112
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,559
He says: what changes the price of a house?

113
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,000
He says, the competition of people demanding houses, in conjunction with local political

114
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,600
opposition, resulting in no new housing, no new estates, and no new builds, increases the

115
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
price of houses.

116
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,120
He says, as the amount of land is a fixed quantity, this resource becomes depleted as population

117
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,759
growth expands.

118
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:10,080
He says the solution is to grow our economy by colonising other planets and solar systems.

119
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,679
Dennis said competition would not usually be cited to cause inflation unless it is with

120
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,679
respect to a global resource, and a monopoly is approached.

121
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:31,559
He says monopolies can certainly cause inflation, as can badly handled quantitative easing.

122
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:43,319
Murry says competition can cause inflation, but only does so where a monopoly exists; e.g.

123
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:51,680
if Apple buys Microsoft, this would lead to a massive control over the market.

124
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,720
He says, we can prevent this by promoting competition, which reduces prices.

125
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,360
He says, communism is a monopoly run by the state.

126
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:14,320
He says, what is important is the global markets, not national ones, when it comes to inflation.

127
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:23,360
Sam says, no, absolutely not: competition does not cause inflation. It reduces prices because

128
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,320
competition means, all else being equal, they compete on prices.

129
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,879
Question 4 was: does the dynamic changes in the prices of goods, material and production,

130
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:46,120
and transportation, cause inflation as a one-way process? i.e. is the reverse -- deflation --

131
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,400
ever possible because of these things?

132
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,440
I only have 3 answers recorded, because this question came as an after-thought, late in the

133
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,280
day within the survey.

134
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:07,600
The answers recorded are from Rob, Murry and Sam. Rob says, yes: deflation can happen.

135
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:20,100
Murry says no; and Sam says no. Rob says growth leads to employment, leading

136
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,240
to the supply of goods and services exceeding the demand for them.

137
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:36,360
He cites: if two different companies are competing, one tries to under-cut the other on prices.

138
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,440
He says, economic activity leads to the supply exceeding the demand.

139
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,039
He says if £2 million in revenue are attained by one company, then it can afford to under-cut

140
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:57,480
its smaller competitors, which might only receive £50,000 in revenue.

141
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,919
He says, the smaller competitor goes bust, and now the larger company has a monopoly, and

142
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,799
so can charge what it likes.

143
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:14,159
He says, business loves monopoly, so competition is ultimately inflationary as its longer-term

144
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,360
consequence.

145
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,480
Murray says, deflation can happen because of dynamic changes in the prices of goods, materials,

146
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,279
and production, and transportation.

147
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:38,519
For example, an event such as a war might lead to the price of petrol becoming elevated.

148
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:49,480
This is inflationary, whereas a surfeit of raw materials would lead to their price falling

149
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,559
except in the case of an oligarchy or monopoly.

150
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:03,480
He says, if labour costs rise, or the cost of iron ore increases, or if the prices of fuel

151
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,839
increases, then these events are massively inflationary.

152
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:16,599
The government may then attempt to bring down inflation by relying on the central bank to

153
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:25,319
vary its interest rates, and also by taxing more, and spending less.

154
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,799
The theory Murry explained to me, was that an increase in national surplus, or a decrease

155
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,559
in the national deficit, would have the consequence of people having less money to afford to buy

156
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:40,240
things, so demand would fall, leading to a fall in prices.

157
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,519
When I say people have less money, this was implying that they have less money in their

158
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,839
pockets, as they have been taxed more.

159
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,200
Murray continued that another government might borrow money, and use this money to pay salaries

160
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,600
to stimulate growth and development.

161
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,240
On the subject of whether deflation can happen,

162
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,160
Sam says deflation has happened in Japan recently.

163
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,240
It happens when there is an excess supply of some kind and demand remains the same, or

164
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,840
when there is a decrease in demand for some reason, e.g. after the Second World War, the

165
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,799
shortage of people led to a reduction in demand, enabling the government to spend more, without

166
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,399
