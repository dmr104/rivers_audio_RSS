00:00.000 --> 00:12.599
Here follows a survey of 8 peoples' ideas about the relationship between taxation and

00:12.599 --> 00:16.480
inflation.

00:16.480 --> 00:26.400
Toward the following 8 people, Lewis, Alwyn, Carol, Lee, Rob, Dennis, Murry, and Sam, the

00:26.399 --> 00:31.759
following 4 questions were asked, to which they responded according to their own insights,

00:31.759 --> 00:38.280
beliefs and viewpoints pertaining to the subject of economic theory.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.839
Question 1.

00:39.839 --> 00:48.280
Is tax a force which reacts to inflation?

00:48.280 --> 00:50.079
Question 2.

00:50.079 --> 00:56.359
Does taxation cause inflation?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.960
Question 3.

00:58.960 --> 01:09.039
Does competition, e.g. Apple vs. Samsung, cause inflation?

01:09.039 --> 01:11.840
Question 4.

01:11.840 --> 01:19.719
Does the dynamic changes in the prices of goods, materials, production and transportation

01:19.719 --> 01:23.879
cause inflation as a one-way process?

01:23.879 --> 01:36.719
i.e. is it possible that the reverse, deflation, can ever happen because of these things?

01:36.719 --> 01:44.919
I collate their answers in the form of yes and no in a table.

01:44.919 --> 01:51.079
Where the answer is don't know or maybe or uncertain, I have indicated this with a question

01:51.079 --> 01:52.879
mark.

01:52.879 --> 01:59.319
Where the answer is not recorded, I have indicated this with a hyphen.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.479
For question 1,

02:01.479 --> 02:08.759
which was, is tax a force which reacts to inflation(?),

02:08.759 --> 02:16.519
all of the participants, bar 2, said yes.

02:16.520 --> 02:26.360
Alwin didn't know; and Sam said yes and no, it depends.

02:26.360 --> 02:33.520
Lewis said the higher inflation is, the higher the price is, so government receives more

02:33.520 --> 02:39.360
revenue in tax.

02:39.360 --> 02:47.360
Alwyn said she doesn't know if inflation leads to a change in the rate of taxation,

02:47.360 --> 02:56.560
or in the amount of revenue the government receives in tax.

02:56.560 --> 03:05.120
Carol said inflation leads to the government adding more taxes.

03:05.120 --> 03:14.680
Lee said inflation causes taxation which is different in each country.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.159
Rob said yes, tax is a reactive force:

03:18.159 --> 03:25.080
as the price of goods, materials, production, transportation costs, etc. changes dynamically,

03:25.080 --> 03:32.400
these changes lead to responsive changes in tax.

03:32.400 --> 03:38.879
If the prices of goods, transport, etc. stay the same, then the rate of taxation is not

03:38.879 --> 03:51.560
altered by the government; it remains the same.

03:51.560 --> 04:00.599
Dennis said the way taxation reacts to inflation is not direct:

04:00.599 --> 04:11.280
the idea of setting the rate of taxes is to encourage or discourage general spending.

04:11.280 --> 04:25.159
He says taxation and inflation are always related; so yes, inflation causes taxation.

04:25.160 --> 04:35.120
Murry said yes, you can try to ease inflation by increasing taxes:

04:35.120 --> 04:42.720
the theory is by taking money out of peoples' pockets they spend less money, meaning that

04:42.720 --> 04:50.800
fewer things are being bought, so prices will come down, which in turn entices people to

04:50.800 --> 04:54.040
purchase.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.520
Murry said tax receipts will increase with inflation;

04:59.520 --> 05:05.720
governments may reduce tax in times of inflation to prevent destitution;

05:05.720 --> 05:16.280
if tax increases, Murry said demand decreases, leading to a slowing of inflation.

05:16.280 --> 05:23.120
Sam's answer to the question, is tax a force which reacts to inflation(?) was, it depends.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.480
Yes and no, he says.

05:26.480 --> 05:34.199
He explains his reasoning in his answer to question 2.

05:34.199 --> 05:41.399
Question 2 was: does taxation cause inflation?

05:41.399 --> 05:49.840
The respondees answered this question in a way which disagreed with each other.

05:49.839 --> 05:59.039
Lewis says yes, taxation causes inflation. Alwyn says yes, Carol says yes.

05:59.039 --> 06:06.239
Initially Lee didn't know, but upon consideration he concluded yes.

06:06.239 --> 06:16.839
Rob says no, taxation does not cause inflation. Dennis says no. Murray says yes; and Sam says

06:16.839 --> 06:22.319
no.

06:22.319 --> 06:30.120
Lewis's reasoning was: he doesn't know if tax causes inflation, but probably yes;

06:30.120 --> 06:37.399
it puts the prices of goods higher because of the tax, and this is to give the government

06:37.399 --> 06:41.599
more revenue.

06:41.600 --> 06:54.320
Alwyn stated taxation causes inflation. Carol says it's supposed not to, but it does.

06:54.320 --> 07:01.439
Lee's final answer was tax causes inflation: this is an open question; there are lots of

07:01.439 --> 07:06.800
influences and factors.

07:06.800 --> 07:15.960
Rob says quite categorically that taxation does not cause inflation.

07:15.960 --> 07:22.680
He says that tax is a reactive force, not an inflationary force.

07:22.680 --> 07:30.040
Rob says that inflation is a force which is caused by competition.

07:30.040 --> 07:36.480
Dennis says taxation does not directly cause inflation.

07:36.480 --> 07:42.400
Murry says it can do, yes.

07:42.400 --> 07:48.240
He says as an aside, interest rates cause inflation.

07:48.240 --> 07:54.120
He says that quantitative easing is a way of printing money, and it will take 30 or 40

07:54.120 --> 08:06.360
years to pay for the quantitative easing which happened following the bank collapse of 2008.

08:06.360 --> 08:12.240
Sam's more circumspect answers are: take the national deficit to be the excess of government

08:12.240 --> 08:19.120
spending above the revenue received from taxation.

08:19.120 --> 08:25.759
If taxation increases and government spending remains the same, then this has the effect

08:25.759 --> 08:38.960
of reducing the deficit, thereby reducing government borrowing or increasing the national surplus --

08:38.960 --> 08:46.159
where national surplus is the excess of government revenue above taxation.

08:46.159 --> 08:57.000
Sam says, as demand remains the same, prices will stay the same, thus inflation won't increase.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.319
But, if taxation increases too much, people will have less money to afford to buy things,

09:03.320 --> 09:16.360
so demand will fall, leading to a fall in prices, i.e. deflation, or a decrease in inflation.

09:16.360 --> 09:25.160
He says, if the government borrows more in order to spend, then this does cause inflation, because

09:25.159 --> 09:35.839
demand will increase, leading to an increase in prices, thereby increasing inflation.

09:35.839 --> 09:44.240
He says, if taxation falls, but spending remains the same, then the national deficit will become

09:44.240 --> 09:53.279
increased, or the national surplus will become reduced.

09:53.399 --> 10:01.199
He says, people will have, in this case, more money, elevating prices, which is inflationary.

10:01.199 --> 10:08.519
But, if taxation falls, but government spending remains the same, this will increase the amount

10:08.519 --> 10:15.159
of money people have to spend, elevating prices, which is inflationary, unless sufficient growth

10:15.159 --> 10:20.120
happens to absorb this change.

10:20.120 --> 10:29.000
Question 3 was: does competition cause inflation?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.960
Our respondees answered as follows.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.960
Lewis says yes.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.240
Alwyn yes.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.799
Carol yes.

10:38.799 --> 10:41.560
Lee, yes and no.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.039
Rob yes.

10:44.039 --> 10:46.399
Dennis no.

10:46.399 --> 10:49.319
Murry yes and no.

10:49.319 --> 10:56.519
Sam says no.

10:56.519 --> 10:58.919
Lewis says yes:

10:58.919 --> 11:01.759
competition causes inflation;

11:01.759 --> 11:09.439
and his reasoning was, the more that manufacturers compete with each other, the more that they

11:09.440 --> 11:17.640
produce, and in turn the more that they produce, the higher their costs are, and so in turn

11:17.640 --> 11:23.400
they will charge more for their goods.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.440
Alwyn who said yes:

11:27.440 --> 11:33.920
competition does cause inflation; because when manufacturers compete with each other they

11:33.920 --> 11:38.360
are putting up prices all the time.

11:38.360 --> 11:45.320
She says, the best products are always sold for the highest prices.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.159
Carol said yes.

11:48.159 --> 11:53.720
I have not recorded an explanation.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.759
Lee says yes and no.

11:57.759 --> 12:07.920
He says that competition causes inflation, but the opposite can also happen;

12:07.919 --> 12:17.799
but essentially the dynamic change of everything other than tax, causes inflation.

12:17.799 --> 12:21.240
That was the viewpoint of Lee.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.199
Rob says yes:

12:23.199 --> 12:27.679
competition causes inflation.

12:27.679 --> 12:33.279
He said the inflationary force is caused by competition.

12:33.279 --> 12:38.559
He says: what changes the price of a house?

12:38.559 --> 12:43.000
He says, the competition of people demanding houses, in conjunction with local political

12:43.000 --> 12:49.600
opposition, resulting in no new housing, no new estates, and no new builds, increases the

12:49.600 --> 12:53.360
price of houses.

12:53.360 --> 12:58.120
He says, as the amount of land is a fixed quantity, this resource becomes depleted as population

12:58.120 --> 13:00.759
growth expands.

13:00.759 --> 13:10.080
He says the solution is to grow our economy by colonising other planets and solar systems.

13:10.080 --> 13:16.679
Dennis said competition would not usually be cited to cause inflation unless it is with

13:16.679 --> 13:21.679
respect to a global resource, and a monopoly is approached.

13:21.679 --> 13:31.559
He says monopolies can certainly cause inflation, as can badly handled quantitative easing.

13:31.559 --> 13:43.319
Murry says competition can cause inflation, but only does so where a monopoly exists; e.g.

13:43.320 --> 13:51.680
if Apple buys Microsoft, this would lead to a massive control over the market.

13:51.680 --> 13:58.720
He says, we can prevent this by promoting competition, which reduces prices.

13:58.720 --> 14:04.360
He says, communism is a monopoly run by the state.

14:04.360 --> 14:14.320
He says, what is important is the global markets, not national ones, when it comes to inflation.

14:14.320 --> 14:23.360
Sam says, no, absolutely not: competition does not cause inflation. It reduces prices because

14:23.360 --> 14:31.320
competition means, all else being equal, they compete on prices.

14:31.320 --> 14:38.879
Question 4 was: does the dynamic changes in the prices of goods, material and production,

14:38.879 --> 14:46.120
and transportation, cause inflation as a one-way process? i.e. is the reverse -- deflation --

14:46.120 --> 14:49.400
ever possible because of these things?

14:49.400 --> 14:54.440
I only have 3 answers recorded, because this question came as an after-thought, late in the

14:54.440 --> 14:57.280
day within the survey.

14:57.279 --> 15:07.600
The answers recorded are from Rob, Murry and Sam. Rob says, yes: deflation can happen.

15:07.600 --> 15:20.100
Murry says no; and Sam says no. Rob says growth leads to employment, leading

15:20.100 --> 15:26.240
to the supply of goods and services exceeding the demand for them.

15:27.200 --> 15:36.360
He cites: if two different companies are competing, one tries to under-cut the other on prices.

15:36.360 --> 15:44.440
He says, economic activity leads to the supply exceeding the demand.

15:44.440 --> 15:50.039
He says if £2 million in revenue are attained by one company, then it can afford to under-cut

15:50.039 --> 15:57.480
its smaller competitors, which might only receive £50,000 in revenue.

15:57.480 --> 16:03.919
He says, the smaller competitor goes bust, and now the larger company has a monopoly, and

16:03.919 --> 16:06.799
so can charge what it likes.

16:06.799 --> 16:14.159
He says, business loves monopoly, so competition is ultimately inflationary as its longer-term

16:14.159 --> 16:18.360
consequence.

16:18.360 --> 16:24.480
Murray says, deflation can happen because of dynamic changes in the prices of goods, materials,

16:24.480 --> 16:29.279
and production, and transportation.

16:29.279 --> 16:38.519
For example, an event such as a war might lead to the price of petrol becoming elevated.

16:38.519 --> 16:49.480
This is inflationary, whereas a surfeit of raw materials would lead to their price falling

16:49.480 --> 16:55.559
except in the case of an oligarchy or monopoly.

16:55.559 --> 17:03.480
He says, if labour costs rise, or the cost of iron ore increases, or if the prices of fuel

17:03.480 --> 17:07.839
increases, then these events are massively inflationary.

17:07.839 --> 17:16.599
The government may then attempt to bring down inflation by relying on the central bank to

17:16.599 --> 17:25.319
vary its interest rates, and also by taxing more, and spending less.

17:25.319 --> 17:30.799
The theory Murry explained to me, was that an increase in national surplus, or a decrease

17:30.799 --> 17:35.559
in the national deficit, would have the consequence of people having less money to afford to buy

17:35.559 --> 17:40.240
things, so demand would fall, leading to a fall in prices.

17:40.240 --> 17:44.519
When I say people have less money, this was implying that they have less money in their

17:44.519 --> 17:49.839
pockets, as they have been taxed more.

17:49.839 --> 17:55.200
Murray continued that another government might borrow money, and use this money to pay salaries

17:55.200 --> 18:01.600
to stimulate growth and development.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.240
On the subject of whether deflation can happen,

18:06.240 --> 18:10.160
Sam says deflation has happened in Japan recently.

18:10.160 --> 18:15.240
It happens when there is an excess supply of some kind and demand remains the same, or

18:15.240 --> 18:20.840
when there is a decrease in demand for some reason, e.g. after the Second World War, the

18:20.839 --> 18:25.799
shortage of people led to a reduction in demand, enabling the government to spend more, without

18:25.799 --> 18:28.399
causing inflation.

18:28.399 --> 18:34.919
He says, if there are countries reliant upon one specific form of goods for export i.e.

18:34.919 --> 18:42.079
oil, then if the global price of oil falls, then less oil is exported, and this will lead

18:42.079 --> 18:48.879
to a reduction in the ability of people within that country to make purchases both domestically

18:48.880 --> 18:53.040
and internationally, i.e. their general demand will have fallen.
